1cf5iow,"For the third day, snipers were deployed in Indiana University due the peaceful protests against genocide, escorted by admin.",l1mtle8,"It's worth clarifying that one of the biggest demonization campaign against Iran of its police supposedly killing a woman for not wearing a headscarf is a complete and demonstrable lie. **There's literal** [**video evidence**](https://x.com/iQMidEastCentre/status/1572572020721987584?t=zW3SHA_ym3UjjKMQKVuXvw&s=09) **showing that she was never even touched, and she collapsed while talking due to pre-existing issues** and then being rushed to the hospital, and photo evidence showing no signs of any injuries. Even the regime change fanatic Masih Alinejad, who gets her funding for the US state dept, initially reported about her heart attack, she changed her story only later on after that line was pushed, her CT scan showing that she wasn't attacked, and even monarchist doctors admitted that she had no injuries ‚Äî they conjured a story which didn't exist the same way they conjured an entire genocide in Xinjiang, and made beheaded babies a thing.

After that arguably the largest bot led online regime change prop took place on the American state dept against Iran. [**In just a month and half there were 350 million tweets, 1/3 of them, i.e 100 million of those by accounts created in the last 2 months (BLM has had 68 million till date)**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDeprogram/s/GVImtuG8AN)

The western media apparatus rushed to try to make this thing into a reality, a campaign to demonize Iran and try a regime change there, **even though 20+ million Iranians rallied in support of their govt after recognising this effort why western media and powers, the mandatory dress code was implemented democratically after a memorandum with 80% votes, and even after the protests** [**it remains popular by a massive landslide.**](https://twitter.com/fresh_sadegh/status/1678368030688944128?t=ivK5e0iXFJYqJXviP3XrHw&s=19)"

1cf5iow,"For the third day, snipers were deployed in Indiana University due the peaceful protests against genocide, escorted by admin.",l1mudiq,"Every single thing can't be stated here, but there was a MASSIVE surge of fake news pushing the most comically evil lies against Iran. Videos from tv shows were spread as coming from Iran (which were notably pushed by zionist JK Rowling), bots misfiring under posts nothing related to it, all sorts of false reports, reports of the police shaving and pulling nails of prisoners who'd then appear perfectly fine smiling with their families. And there was a lot of the rape atrocity propaganda as well, comically evil claims of police raping and killing women (reminiscent of ""Gaddafi is giving viagra to rape women"" lie), or police is raping women so that they don't enter heaven, apart from all being baseless, it's something that's so absurd that one doesn't even know where to begin, especially considering rape has death penalty in Iran.


Apart from propaganda, weapons were poured in to create more chaos and violence. KDP admitted to giving weapons to protesters to spread chaos and Bolton admitted that weapons were being smuggled in for these purposes and people doing this were celebrated and supported by that crowd. It was massively pushed by bots, Iranian regime change diaspora (who are now rabidly showing support for the genocide of Palestinians), celebrities, and radical feminists, who now also pushed the Zionist Hamas mass rape lie that wasn't credible even for a second and relied almost entirely on a person being bigoted.

Similarly when ISIS committed the worst attack on Iranian soil since its independence this January killing and injuring hundreds (coincidentally just when ""Israel"" was trying to get Iran involved), some from the crowd outright celebrated it. The regime change diaspora has been trying to get Iran attacked and invaded ever since by pointing out that it's Iran that has been crucially supporting the Palestinian resistance and thus it's Iran that should be attacked.

NGO:

Another who pushed it was the western funded NGO class, and if you look into their funding, it doesn't take long to see it for what it is. One of the most popular such NGOs, DHRC, is funded **almost entirely** by western govt and orgs that are widely considered to be an extension of U.S. state. The funders include the notorious NED, the go-to arm of CIA, George Soros's Open society foundation, Freedom house which according to western media received funding to carry out clandestine operations on Iran, Mccains institute, and a lot lot more shady groups. It's almost as CIA as it gets"

So the ICC won't let me be
Or let me be free, so let me see
They try to bring me to trial internationally
But it feels so liberating without me

So come on, deny, lie on your lips, forget that
Deny everything and falsify evidence and get ready 'cause this case is about to get messy
I just bribed all my jurors
Screw you, justice!

Among the Indian people, on the other hand, there's a diversity of opinion. Among Muslims and a plurality of Hindus, attitudes range from staunchly anti-Israel to sympathy for both sides and a two-state solution, while a significant minority of right-wing Hindus recognise the aforementioned common ground between Hindu nationalism and Zionism as a front against an existential war against Muslims."

I hope these people get what they deserve, too. But, while you may freely express support all forms of resistance here, please use discipline with your language and neither express explicit nor implicit calls to violence.

What these people deserve is to live to see the collapse of the zionist entity and its relegation to the place in history we reserve for humanity's greatest shames. They deserve to have the positions they hold so proudly become ones they have to hide in shame. What we should hope - and sincerely work for - though,  is that they live long enough to see the truth and join our ranks."

Reddit isn't where your or anyone's advocacy for Palestine should culminate. This is where it should begin and develop. This and other subs are resources. Resources for information, for facts, for talking points, and for the sophistication of your ability to participate in the movement in word and deed in the real world. 

Saying you hope ppl get what they deserve, and leaving that ambiguous, is not a get out of jail free card. It's an unfinished thought that leaves an invitation for misrepresentation at best. As with almost all things, there is no best way to practice your solidarity, but you can always get better and more effective at it."

I'm a little surprised that UK campuses haven't burst into song yet. The London protests haven't stopped. It's only a matter of time though. I'm sure there are already London universities displaying their colours at the marches.

1cectgb,Is the start of something miraculous for Palestinians?,l1ixia0,"While you are correct, and it is very hopeful to see this sea change, I think it‚Äôs an important exercise to start thinking about where we go from here and how this actually resolves itself. There are still fundamental truths on the ground that make the endgame very very difficult. 

Israel is backed by fundamentalist right wing religious zealots, armed to the teeth, and nuclear capability. We‚Äôve collectively moved from focus on boycotts, to divestment. This week we started to hear calls for sanctions and treating Israel as a rogue state for the first time. We need to ask what that actually means on the ground, and how Israelis will respond to a legitimate existential threat. What will they do to Palestinians if the existence of Palestinians continues to put pressure on their own ability to exist? Deportation? Camps? Worse? Who will step up and stop them? It‚Äôs one thing for countries to recognize statehood, quite another to take action against Israel, a country that is filled with dual citizens from the west. 

We need real leaders on the ground to start shaping the end, a single state for all people. Until I see that, I fear the worst is yet to come."

Germany is still vocally with israel btw, in addition to te US, not that this matters that much, because UNRWA funding is cut to nothing anyway"
1cectgb,Is the start of something miraculous for Palestinians?,l1iwpmm,Nothing will change until boomers and to a lesser extent gen x no longer hold the bulk of political power in the west. When millennials and gen z hold the reins I think it‚Äôs game over for Israel if it continues to try to exist as an aggressive entity. Palestinians have to hold on for a decade or so after which I think things will begin to change rapidly. I believe this may be part of the reason for the increase in the speed of Israel‚Äôs colonisation and genocide which increased before October the 7th. I really hope they can hang on.

1cectgb,Is the start of something miraculous for Palestinians?,l1k2wpb,"Bisan is feeling hope because of those college kids and so are many people in Gaza right now. Because here's the thing most of you didn't know Netenyahu is an Alumni of Havard and MIT. And it's not just him, many politicians world wide are Alumni of Ivy league schools. And right now the kids in these schools are the relatives and children and famous doctor's, lawyers, diplomats, royalty, celebrities, business executives, CEOs, etc. Once one Ivy league school bends their knees to the students demands to divest from Israel, the rest will follow and it will be a shot in the heart for Netanyahu's power. Once the colleges fell, the rest followed, it worked for ending the war in Vietnam, it helped end Aparthied South Africa, and Israel's occupation will fall slowly once the Ivy League says okay to divestmenting from Israel. Afterwards other businesses will follow because if an Ivy League school is saying it's not worth it to invest in Israel, other businesses will pull out saying, ""Hey it's not profitable to invest in Israel."" Thus making things way too expensive to keep the occupation and eventually AIPAC will fall too for US politicians and politicians world wide will falter next.  
It's the domino effect."

1cectgb,Is the start of something miraculous for Palestinians?,l1k5gdc,Politically no but globally yes. I would say confidently that majority of the world sides with Palestine. But just as it‚Äôs taken 75 years for the apartheid it will also take that much longer.

1cebt3p,"What was your stance on the Palestine-Israeli before Oct 7? If it has changed, why has it? ",l1hru7r,"When I was 18, my friend explained the Palestine situation to me. I have been fervently pro Palestine ever since. I'm now 40.

It helps that I'm Irish as we have an underground culture of support for Palestine.

A neighbour down the road from me has been flying the tricolour and the Palestine flag side by side for maybe 20 years.

I've had the Palestine flag on all my profiles since Sheikh Jarrah!"
1cebt3p,"What was your stance on the Palestine-Israeli before Oct 7? If it has changed, why has it? ",l1hj53i,"I was unaware of much, and like you relatively neutral and hoped mostly for peace.

There was a lot I didn't know about and I feel that some major media outlets have deliberately hushed up the truth about all the atrocities the Palestinians have been subjected to for over 70 years.

Edit, im just sad."
1cebt3p,"What was your stance on the Palestine-Israeli before Oct 7? If it has changed, why has it? ",l1hlrqc,It was mostly indifferent. I knew Israel was committing crimes against humanity and they were constantly sanctioned by the UN but it didn't register the extent of Israel's cruelty until after Oct 7. They went full on mask off Nazi with the blatant killings. I realized the Zionists were always like this and I was not paying attention.
1cebt3p,"What was your stance on the Palestine-Israeli before Oct 7? If it has changed, why has it? ",l1hlaqq,"I grew up amongst many Palestinians. They constantly told us horror stories. Yet, looking back it is scary how oblivious we were to what they relayed.

Before Oct 7 I had given up hope. I knew enough about Palestinian politics to be able to determine that they were at the brink of complete loss. Meaning, settlers were so normalized, that gradually the West Bank would be completely swallowed.

Gaza on the other hand was an anomaly. In 2005 Israel completely withdrew from Gaza. Meaning settlers in Gaza were not able to keep up. Although the West Bank is larger and had more of the governing authority, this is a miracle.

I guess what I am saying is: even though I had given up hope and pictures a bleak future, there were two things that left a candle. Gaza, and their spirit of resistance, and the special place that Al-Aqsa holds in the hearts of the bigger nation."
1cebt3p,"What was your stance on the Palestine-Israeli before Oct 7? If it has changed, why has it? ",l1hp4pi,"Well it dawned to me that all the conflicts I have seen in Israel/Palestine since the 80s was NOT about destroying PLO, Hamas or Hizbollah. It was always about destroying Palestine and its people, it was always about ethnic cleansing.

And it has been like this for many more decades than I thought. It is just that it goes hundreds of times faster and more ruthless now, the settlers are going berzerks because they knew that the military have their back and the law will not touch them.

And the same goes for the Israel military and the Israel government,, no matter their war crimes, how many kids they kill - they will always get more money and support from UK, US and too many other countries."
1cebt3p,"What was your stance on the Palestine-Israeli before Oct 7? If it has changed, why has it?

1cebt3p,"What was your stance on the Palestine-Israeli before Oct 7? If it has changed, why has it? ",l1husjw,"I grew up in Scotland, and I would often see Palestinian flags hanging from windows, there was sometimes a Palestinian stall on one of the big streets in Glasgow. Being in a smaller country trying to gain more autonomy from a larger country (Scotland and England/UK) made me more sympathetic to other regions with national identities, like Catalonia or Quebec. I can‚Äôt pinpoint when I learned more about the power imbalance between Israel/Palestine, the settlers in the West Bank, but definitely in the last few years I've learned more about it."
1cebt3p,"What was your stance on the Palestine-Israeli before Oct 7? If it has changed, why has it? ",l1hromd,"Not Palestinian, but I grew up around this issue, so I knew events were clearly leading up to an extermination campaign, which we're seeing play out now.

I'm just glad that the rest of the world can see it now too. The ghastly/disgusting true face of israel that many Palestinians and those around them have always known about, but was still hidden from average people because not everyone reads Al Jazeera or knows Palestinians personally."

1cebt3p,"What was your stance on the Palestine-Israeli before Oct 7? If it has changed, why has it? ",l1hx8qo,"I was taught about Israel and Palestine correctly by my muslim community growing up and I researched further and shared what I learned to my friends and classmates in college but I didn‚Äôt know anything about Hamas and Palestinian politics details beyond the basic dates of treaties and the nakba, so I learned *a lot* since October 7th and there is still much I dont know"
1cebt3p,"What was your stance on the Palestine-Israeli before Oct 7? If it has changed, why has it? ",l1hycj8,"On the side of the Palestinians, but the plight of Palestine did not come on my radar until I learned about the tear gassing and violent intimidation at Al-Aqsa mosque in 2021. Then I learned about the Great March of Return and it‚Äôs been crystal clear who is in the wrong here ever since.

I grew up in a Zionist (Christian Evangelical) household but never really agreed with or understood the philosophy behind Zionism, just understood the significance of Israel as a holy land with lots of history."
1cebt3p,"What was your stance on the Palestine-Israeli before Oct 7? If it has changed, why has it? ",l1i71vt,"I have a lot of Jewish friends and would often here about Israel in a positive light, as a safe place for Jews and my impression has been there were always Jews there basically by themselves and they just expanded into the desert or something. I had no idea about the Nakba , the ethnic cleansing of Arabic speaking people from some 500 villages, until the last couple of years. I knew of the illegal settlements, but other than some occasional finger wagging the US wasnr going to do much about it. Hamas and other Arab entities always portrayed as the aggressor.  Now I understand how entwined the US and Israel are militarily and how the uS government gives them carte blanche. The hypocrisy of claiming the uS defend human rights and ignores Israel's behavior. Have to say, just before Israeli ground forces entered Gaza, Blinken said something as if he were the Secretary of Israel, something like "" WE are going to Gaza"" and I was still shocked.  My government is absolutely complicit. The way American politicians make excuses for Israel and lie directly on camera about things we see with our own eyes.  It's become clear that if Palestinians complain about being oppressed in any way, the western media calls them terrorists. The mask is also off with the Israeli Army. They portray themselves as 'the most moral' and the videos they post of themselves during this have been utterly vile. Like I have never seen soldiers display their blood thirsty dehumanization of especially children is just deranged. The excuses for murdering entire families because an AI program told them a Hamas support might possibiy live there. It's depraved. It's pure evil. The Israeli army can't defeat Hamas 'man to man' so it bombs from above and blows up their children. Israel is never coming back from this."
1cebt3p,"What was your stance on the Palestine-Israeli before Oct 7? If it has changed, why has it? ",l1icbty,I‚Äôm from Ireland and most people here were pro Palestine long before the war in Gaza as we felt solidarity with the Palestinian people. But I wasn‚Äôt aware of the full extent of the tyranny until recently.
1cebt3p,"What was your stance on the Palestine-Israeli before Oct 7? If it has changed, why has it? ",l1igud1,"I am speaking purely as a white woman from the states; I knew nothing about Palestine and the Israeli occupation before Oct 7. When news broke out that Hamas attacked a music festival and captured people I wasn‚Äôt sure where I stood. From what little I knew after that I understood after that I knew Palestine was under occupation and the IOF are their oppressors so I was leaning in favor of free Palestine. But then the days went on things fell into perspective. The Israeli propaganda kept falling apart since there was never any evidence to back up their claims. I learned about the Nakba, of the discrimination and abuse they face. I watched as things got worse and worse, watched as innocent people were slaughtered indiscriminately, listened to the laughter and demented joy of the IOF soldiers as they flattened universities, attacked hospitals, bakeries, people. I saw videos of IOF soldiers dragging, running over, defiling corpses of Palestinians. I saw the hatred and bloodlust in the souls of the settlers, then I saw the love in Palestinians. I learned Israeli is an outpost of the US and the Western world that serves only to further destabilize the region and that our taxes pay for every bomb and bullet they use. Everything I learned, everything I saw, everything I heard pushed me more and more towards supporting freedom for Palestine, completely and unapologetically. In short, what changed my mind was the truth."
1cebt3p,"What was your stance on the Palestine-Israeli before Oct 7? If it has changed, why has it? ",l1hnacv,"I was always pro-Palestinian, but didn't use my voice to cry out for the cause. In 2014, 2018, 2020 I would look at pictures of Palestinians killed in Gaza and cry but didn't feel like I could do anything about it. Now I'm much more of an activist and try to learn more and do whatever I can for the cause.¬†"
1cebt3p,"What was your stance on the Palestine-Israeli before Oct 7? If it has changed, why has it? ",l1husm4,"I was a little educated about the history of it before, which is a history of displacement, colonization, occupation, apartheid, resistance portrayed as terrorism... So when oct 7 th happened, It was very infuriating to see that it was not allowed to talk about the context of the attack, without being treated of antisemitic. 

But anyway, what has really changed for me is the illusion that Israel was untouchable. I thought that Palestinians  could only watch their land, wealth and right being taken away even more, slowly but surely. But Oct 7th sent a message : security for Israeli would not be guaranteed as long as the colonization and occupation would continue."

I heard on NPR the Ohio senate were putting into law that businesses that publicly speak out against Israel would not be eligible to receive state contracts. ¬†I was like ‚Äúsomething aint right with that‚Äù.


I went to work and talked to a coworker. Turned out he‚Äôs half Palestinian, his family are Christian Palestinians from the West Bank. He told me about his family‚Äôs struggles and how their house is very rural but gets shot at for no reason. I looked up some stuff on my own but it only cemented what he had told me.¬†From that day on I was pro-Palestine.¬†


Since Oct 7 I‚Äôve been more active in my support by donating as much as possible to PCRF and Doctors without Borders. I turned my IG into a pro-Palestine feed only and removed all my person friends and pictures. The day we found out Hind Rajab and the paramedics were murdered I cried to my mom. I‚Äôm 35. I‚Äôve slowly helped her become pro-Palestine too!¬†"

After Oct 7th I feel the tide has turned and the majority of good people can finally see what the Palestinians have been enduring for the last 76 years. 

My support and my family's support for Palestine has only grown. We are no longer afraid to be labelled ""terrorist sympathisers"" and proudly display all things Palestine on our house, vehicle etc, as have our neighbours. My dad is 75 years old and attended the biggest march in London, despite heart issues and struggling with the walk, he did it and I could not be more proud."

I remember hearing ""occupied west bank"" in the news now and again but not knowing where it was or who was occupying it.

I started working with refugees and started studying Arabic and middle-eastern history. We had one or two seminars on Israel which was literally the opposite of all the casual propaganda we'd heard throughout our lives. The lesson was full of confused students asking questions and the lecturers barely scratched the surface and recommended ""the new historians"" from Israel.

Was most struck by Ilan Pappe's books and was absolutely horrified and went down a rabbit hole, wrote my exam on it. 

I was neutral/uninformed about 5 years ago now firmly pro-Palestine.

My wife is Arab, and she has always been \*vehemently\* outspoken against Israel, but I didn't really pay attention (tbf, she hasn't explained anything to me either).

After Oct 7th, I must say I was still on the fence (honestly, the propaganda - in the guise of ""online discussion"" here on reddit - has worked on me as well). But it didn't take much time for me to completely change my mind; they were (and still are) posting all their war crimes online. And then, reading further in the events prior to Oct 7th and the history of the region... goddamn, my blood still boils.

Then it clicked: I remembered in 2010 going to Israel for a day while on a cruise ship, and vividly remember the checkpoint we passed through to reach Bethlehem; these 19-something years old with huge american M16s jumping in our bus and check everyone.

I asked my parents how people were acting like it was OK and it started a conversation about the conditions Palestinians live in and particularly the illegal settlements that were going on. My dad is Muskogee so he has some very definite feelings on settler colonialism. My folks are old hippies who had to tone it down to keep their jobs and such, but that's when I learned they've been pro Palestinian liberation since the seventies or eighties.

Unsurprisingly, I was raised to have unwavering support for the Palestinian cause. However, I‚Äôm also Cypriot (+grew up in Cyprus), and I‚Äôve seen how hate and division only leads to more pain and suffering in the long run. So I was always the person in my family that had a ‚Äúforgive and move on‚Äù attitude to Israel\Palestine. It‚Äôs the same thing I wish for Cyprus, forgive, unify the island, and live together. I‚Äôm not oblivious to how utterly naive that sounds. (And it goes without saying that the severity of the Cyprus problem is no where near that of Israel-Palestine)

Since Oct. 7th, I‚Äôve come to understand how people can get radicalised. I actually was shocked at how I started to feel less and less humanity for the Israeli people. It‚Äôs not something I‚Äôm proud of. 

I used to be the person at family gatherings that would say, ‚Äúyeah it sucks that Palestinians were expelled from their homeland, but Israel is there. Generations of Israeli people were born there and that‚Äôs now their home. I don‚Äôt advocate for doing to them what they did to the Palestinians. We‚Äôre better than that.‚Äù Not a popular opinion, to say the least. 

I still believe that in principle, but not wholeheartedly. I‚Äôve seen how high ranking Israeli officials talk about Palestinians and Arabs more broadly. I‚Äôve also seen how little regard the west has for Arab lives. I live in Germany, and the 0 tolerance policy for any expression sympathetic to the Palestinian people for fear of antisemitism has made me actually loathe this country. I‚Äôve seen how Germans now feel like they have a ‚Äúget out of jail free‚Äù card to spew the most hateful and racist rhetoric imaginable when it comes to Arabs now. 

And of course, the human cost in Gaza is just heartbreaking. I don‚Äôt understand how human beings from anywhere in the world can look at the horrors Israel has inflicted upon the Gaza Strip and continue to send weapons and financial support. The west is a joke."

Post October 7th and I still supported Israel and believed that what happened on that day was a genocide. Only after talking with a friend who‚Äôs also formerly religious who reads a lot about this stuff did I actually start doing research instead of trusting what I was told by my parents and by the rabbis of my community. I was obviously horrified by what was actually happening and horrified that someone would ‚Äúdefend their brothers‚Äù for doing such atrocities. 

For what it‚Äôs worth, alongside this I learnt a lot about Jewish history and learnt a lot about Jews victimization tactics as well as their inability to function alongside society well and I in the process of this learnt that a lot of the times when Jews were being persecuted there was rightful reason for them to be attacked, but obviously in school they never taught me about this and instead taught us a totally different story and just kind of told me that people hated Jews for no reason.

I‚Äôm a fairly politically engaged person, and tend to focus on international issues, so I was already aware of the situation and the history back to Herzl and the original Zionist project. I couldn‚Äôt find any reason to sympathize with or side with the Israelis. From 1948 to now, there‚Äôs been nothing just in their actions and policies. I had a Gazan classmate in my Master‚Äôs program, in Spain, who I‚Äôve been unable to reach since October 7th. A few years ago I had a relationship with a Gazan woman I still remain close with. She fortunately doesn‚Äôt live in Gaza and is herself fine, though has had family murdered by the IDF. These things pushed me even further to the Palestinian cause.

 Then I went to Palestine in 2022. I saw the apartheid and injustice with my own eyes. I experienced the difference in the people too‚ÄîI did not talk politics with any Israelis, carried no symbols or any other outward show of my stance, and was still treated with suspicion, coldness, and sometimes contempt for just not being one of them. I‚Äôve been to nearly 50 countries, and Israelis‚Äîeven before Oct 7‚Äìare by far the most unpleasant group I‚Äôve ever met. Conversely, Palestinians in Bethlehem, Ramallah, and Jericho treated me like a long lost brother. I was invited into homes from dinner, had a shopkeeper give me a free ride back to the highway to catch a bus back to my al-Quds hotel without needing to pay a taxi, etc. Those experiences sealed it. 

Since Oct 7‚Ä¶I always knew Netanyahu and his cronies would try this if they thought they could get away with it, so the only thing that has changed is I‚Äôve gone from thinking ‚Äúthere must at least be some decently sized percentage of Israeli citizens who know their government is wrong and policies unjust, even if only like 5%‚Äù to seeing that such people are so few in number as to statistically be 0."

Never interacted with Jews until my adult life and they were very friendly and supportive people. None that I knew had strong feelings about Israel but were proud of their culture and people, which I respect a lot. Nowadays I try to educate myself more on their history and side of it which is also really sad but eye opening. If you look at everything that was done to them way before the 1940s, then you'll start to understand why they react the way they do. I can't be completely mad at them for it. 

Regardless, I'm still supportive of the Palestinians cause based on reality at this point in time. Israel still has everything stacked in their favor especially where it matters."

",l1jqcab,"I was pro Palestinian freedom prior to October 7, and when the news broke at the time I was worried a lot of people would die from the consequences afterwards. Sadly this is all too true. I just can‚Äôt wrap my head around the embedded hatred that the most rabid Israelis have for their distant cousins who have lived in Palestine for centuries. The extent of the atrocities, sadism and disregard for the lives of even children and babies has only strengthened my pro Palestinian stance."

1cebt3p,"What was your stance on the Palestine-Israeli before Oct 7? If it has changed, why has it? ",l1hym0m,"I grew up in my formative years (8-16)in France, so I was of the idea that israel was the Jewish nation and was the good guy, and Palestinians were terrorists, along with Hezbollah(that made me quite weird at family reunions as they were all pro hezb).

That was up until 2006 cause see, my 0-8 I grew up in Lebanon as I'm Lebanese. And in 2006 I couldn't reconcile the good guy (israel) going to war against Lebanon and killing so many civilians instead of only the terrorists from Hezbollah. It made no sense. So I educated myself on the history of Palestine and on Hezbollah. Since then I became staunchly pro Palestine and pro resistance (I was always pro human rights, so one could say I just opened my eyes to the reality). 

Before Oct 7, I thought Hamas, while a resistance movement, was also a terrorist movement.

Since Oct 7, I've educated myself on Hamas, their charter, their strategy etc.

I no longer consider them terrorists. I find them not only legitimate, but morally sound.

However, I'd like them to learn a little more from Hezbollah, where they show more restraints towards civilians (I'm specifically referencing Oct 7)."

1cebt3p,"What was your stance on the Palestine-Israeli before Oct 7? If it has changed, why has it? ",l1jtrnr,"I've been for Palestinian human rights for many years. I remember seeing a new story about an IOF soldier getting killed by a thrown rock and then seeing coverage of the retaliation. They were bombing markets. Over 100 civilians died in retaliation for one IOF soldier. I thought that was insane overkill and despicable.

Then, a few weeks later, I stumbled across a story about how the Israeli government quietly admitted that it has arrested the *teenagers* responsible soon after the incident had happened, and that the killing was an accident because they didn't expect the stone to do any real harm, let alone kill someone.

They knew who had done it and arrested them. They knew it wasn't a terrorist attack and that the kids weren't associated with Hamas or anything like that. But they still used it as an excuse to murder 100+ civilians just because they could.

That turned me very quickly. And each new conflict has only validated it."

1cebt3p,"What was your stance on the Palestine-Israeli before Oct 7? If it has changed, why has it? ",l1kbi8k,I visited Israel in 1998 and even back then you could see the signs of apartheid. With the proliferation of the Internet it was relatively simple to see it get worse and worse. There were/are quit a few progressive Jews who fight against the Zionist. Only now is it so overt that anyone being critical of Israel is attacked and labelled an anti-semite. I typically post free Palestine to encourage dialogue on progressive sites and today you get less support from progressive Jews. AIPAC and the money that backs them are going after every demographic and not leaving up to chance. It's odd that the opposite side hates the LGBTQ community and treats women like cattle and your faced with having to wholesale support them to counter the AIPAC machine.

I had to quickly call out a few people on socials for quickly jumping to sympathize with the devil (Israel) and actually, yes we condemn certain aspects of the incident that were horrendous it doesn't make all Hamas be the evil ones and the IDF the righteous ones, as some seem to think. At best best both Hamas and the IDF are as bad as each other. At worst the IDF and Israel should know a lot better.  
Did also have to point out that the Israels like their leadership/regime about as much as the Palestinians do too.

Then I started to see the videos coming out and how the IOF would snipe kids and Palestinians randomly. Once there was no confirmation of those 40 babies and how the IOF was making fun of Palestinians I started to wonder if Hamas was even a terrorist group. I always go back to that lady who was interviewed by Rebel news saying as much. I'm not in favor of anyone dying. However, I understand why October 7th happened. As a Christian myself I don't believe Israel is a place since Israel is a people. The land belongs to the Palestinians. I've never seen Hamas kick and spit on Christians."

You CANT be a terrorist if you're under an occupation. Period. my opinion has not changed, and will never change. The goal of October 7th was to capture an isreali soldier in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. They got one and traded about 1027 prisoners. But theres more. During oct 7th isreal used THEIR OWN air craft to bomb THEIR OWN people. I believe that Palestine has a RIGHT to defend themselves. So no it wasn't a terrorist attack. I have my limits with Hamas because again, Hamas was created by isreal. But they are helping Palestine.

In my freshman year of college I took a course on human rights taught by a German Jewish professor and learned about how Israel was established and the human rights abuses they commit. In 2022 I began talking to my current fianc√© after I criticized the US giving money to Israel on social media, as he was surprised to see somebody from the school he attends speaking out. That was also when I started reading Edward Said‚Äôs work. I started boycotting Israeli companies in 2021 without anyone telling me to but I was unaware of how many major corporations had money going to the IOF until last year. So, I was already very pro-Palestinian liberation before last year, I just didn‚Äôt know as much as I do now. I don‚Äôt just get all of my info from social media, I have been reading and I‚Äôm currently doing research on displaced Palestinians in Lebanon which requires extensive reading about the Nakba and its aftermath."

I know my mum has always supported good causes, and hated Margaret Thatcher (a true leftie Brit!). I did research myself as well, because I didn‚Äôt want to just blindly follow my mum. And needless to say, like mother like daughter. I was horrified by Israel and the way they have oppressed Palestinians for decades.
So since then I‚Äôve been pro Pal.
I am horrified that it is such a divisive topic. 
But it‚Äôs always interesting to see what pro Israel supporters come up with. They love the ‚Äúeducate yourself and stop learning everything from Tik Tok.‚Äù They use that a lot. Like I don‚Äôt have tik tok, but it will certainly be less biased than the MSM. 
Or my new favourite ‚Äúwhite coloniser‚Äù. Haha makes me laugh. I gently tell them I am of Irish descent and that my ancestors understand oppression well. The irony of calling us white colonisers when you have a white woman called Karen, moving to the West Bank and taking a Palestinians home. 
Honestly, it‚Äôs baffling. 
I live in Germany and attended a protest in the small city I live in. One guy in the street blew us kisses, another gave us the finger.
I have to say, it was so heartwarming to see middle aged white German people wearing keffiyehs and waving the Palestinian flag. A lot of young students too. And this warmed my heart, but while listening to the speakers, I turned around at one point and there was an old white guy with a walking stick. He was listening to the speakers, and then joined in with the applause. Almost like maybe he experienced living in nazi Germany as a small child and could draw the similarities. Who knows. But anyway, it made me happy. Free Palestine üáµüá∏"

Also I know about the US base on Israel, and since there‚Äôs been unnecessary conflict btwn Iran and US (which also has a long history due to Kissinger assassinating a lot of people he didn‚Äôt like) I figured the talk was will be towards Iran. Of course Israel has always been hostile in the region, and towards Palestinians like a terrible bully, a deadly bully.¬†

It‚Äôs really screwed up, and it all feels unnecessary. So I suspect it‚Äôs all about grabbing oil and other resources.¬†

Wars have never made sense to me, since learning about how devastating it is: A perfectly beautiful and functioning country gets turned into rubble, people backstabbing each other fighting for scraps, the criminal element usually rise up and screws the country up even more.¬†

1cebt3p,"What was your stance on the Palestine-Israeli before Oct 7? If it has changed, why has it? ",l1iegxu,">In 1910‚Äì1911 Arabs in the north tried to resist the Zionist purchase of and settlement in a large tract of land in the Jezreel Valley. Ironically, the opposition focused on the tenant farmer village of Fula, built on and around the ruins of La FeÃÄve, a Crusader fortress Saladin had conquered in 1187. Henceforward, Arab spokesmen were regularly to identify the Zionists as the ""new Crusaders."" Arab notables sent off a stream of appeals to Istanbul, shots were traded, and an Arab and a settlement guard were killed. But nothing availed.  
>  
>The authorities upheld the purchase, Fula was evacuated, and within months, a Jewish settlement, Merhavia, took root on the site.

The colonization started even earlier. The first expulsion by settlers happened under the Ottomans. The Ottomans bungled the best chance to strangle them in the crib by repressing the pro-Ottoman settlers in World War I rather than just sending them to die in battle against the Entente. The Yishuv had been in very bad shape at the time, but they ended up driving them directly into the arms of the British. They'd even turned a blind eye to the Armenian genocide, which was nothing new. In the 1890s, right after the Hamidian massacres, Herzl had offered to not only pay off a decent chunk of the Empire‚Äôs debts, but do PR work for them, in exchange for full rights on Palestine. Fear of provoking the Ottoman was a factor in the Yishuv continuing to back them (the Ottomans nearly embarked on a killing spree in Palestine, but were stopped by a German Field Marshal), yes, but the main reason for their inaction was their callous indifference and their near-total focus on their colonial project.

In fact, the Ottomans only tried to exterminate the settlers after several dozen young Zionists witnessed the Armenian genocide and then decided to help the British. Unlike Herzl, these young men and women were horrified and decided that the best way to stop the killing was for the Entente to defeat the Ottomans as quickly as possible. So, they formed a [NILI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nili), a spy ring, to help the British. Yes, they were still Zionists, but they did truly care about the fate of the Armenians. They wrote reports about the mass killings and tried to spread news of the genocide. Their compassion of those spies for the Armenians was not the only way they stood out. Many of them had more moderate views towards Palestinians."

We should not demonize people who are simply misinformed and have been lied to. 

I'd been telling my wife this over and over again - there  were a lot of kind-hearted Americans out there who were not hesitant in siding with the truth in a moment. She'd been more anti West and to be fair, sorta justifiably so looking at how the US gov and the EU had been behaving. 

Then the mass protests at US universities happened. I was so glad and told my wife these were the people I kept telling her about. She's in my camp now.

1cebt3p,"What was your stance on the Palestine-Israeli before Oct 7? If it has changed, why has it? ",l1jzn8u,lol you reminded me when me and my cousins used to river dance but do the Arabic hand arm movements at the same time. We combined the two somehow.
1cebt3p,"What was your stance on the Palestine-Israeli before Oct 7? If it has changed, why has it? ",l1iywnd,"And despite this, Herzl is still honored in Israel."
1cebt3p,"What was your stance on the Palestine-Israeli before Oct 7? If it has changed, why has it? ",l1mdmzo,"Thanks a lot for sharing, while it‚Äôs sad to hear about your aunt just the fact that both you and your dad sympathize with Palestinians now gives me so much hope! I am hoping that there will be more and more people like you."
1cebt3p,"What was your stance on the Palestine-Israeli before Oct 7? If it has changed, why has it? ",l1ifaji,"interesting. 

I considered myself 'impartial' in the past. Looking back at it, I feel ashamed because oppressors love the neutral because to them, those who are neutral are basically enablers. 

What's your take on that?"
1cebt3p,"What was your stance on the Palestine-Israeli before Oct 7? If it has changed, why has it? ",l1jvuf0,"They're getting better but I think they're still very selective about the way they word things, a bit too much for my liking, they use language like ""hostages in Gaza & prisoners in israel"" and things like ""israels war on Hamas"" I know they have to be careful but it reminds me of how they used to report during the troubles, eg: ""security services had to shoot someone vs IRA terrorists murdered someone etc"
1cebt3p,"What was your stance on the Palestine-Israeli before Oct 7? If it has changed, why has it? ",l1l7ch2,"I would challenge this notion. From a Muslim standpoint we saw our heights of civilization where religion was allowed in the public square. The Western post-modern project built on those successes but couldn‚Äôt have been possible without it.

If you look at the Ottomon empire you find the same as well where religions co-existed. Just because one is dominant it doesn‚Äôt mean other communities can‚Äôt thrive"
1cebt3p,"What was your stance on the Palestine-Israeli before Oct 7? If it has changed, why has it? ",l1ieqku,You think they want all of Palestine? I read that speech by Ben Gurion in 1930s and I wish more people would read that. It's clear as day.
1cebt3p,"What was your stance on the Palestine-Israeli before Oct 7? If it has changed, why has it? ",l1ilmr6,That's unfortunate but it does make sense. Thanks for sharing and glad you're on our side!
1cebt3p,"What was your stance on the Palestine-Israeli before Oct 7? If it has changed, why has it? ",l1iqkod,"I think it depends on the power you hold. I think you shouldn‚Äôt be impartial if you can make a difference or if you have a platform. 

Ideally everyone would be activists but there‚Äôs a lot of people who are busy in their day to day life with work and keeping food on the table so they don‚Äôt have the time to be out protesting."
1cebt3p,"What was your stance on the Palestine-Israeli before Oct 7? If it has changed, why has it? ",l1k1iu5,True there is a double standard.
1cebt3p,"What was your stance on the Palestine-Israeli before Oct 7? If it has changed, why has it? ",l1ievf6,Palestine and beyond
1cebt3p,"What was your stance on the Palestine-Israeli before Oct 7? If it has changed, why has it? ",l1isg7b,that's fair
1cebt3p,"What was your stance on the Palestine-Israeli before Oct 7? If it has changed, why has it? ",l1ihl67,Parts of Lebanon Jordon and Egypt.   The Christian Zionists want this too - it‚Äôs not just AIPAC money at the heart of the US issue it‚Äôs also all the Christian Zionist money.  They want their rapture and the land grab comes first.

The Ministry attributes this crisis to Israel's blockade, which prevents the entry of chlorine or any alternative for treating drinking water through chlorination. 

This exacerbates the situation as public health laboratories lack the capacity to test drinking water. Consequently, all citizens of the Strip are compelled to drink unsafe water, putting their lives at risk."

At the same time we shouldn't lose sight of the broader conflict. A hasbara favourite is the idea that the conflict began on  October 7th. The last thing they want is for people to have a wide angle view of the conflict. This all begins with the settlement and expulsion of Palestinians from their ancestral lands by European settlers.

Observing facts is a good thing, but ascribing a connection between race and being of low moral fiber is not. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy: if you think that someone's race causes them to be evil, you will just assume everything they do is for the sake of evil and you'll never be able to see them as other human beings like yourself. Just like it would be racist to say that white Europeans raped the world *because* white people are inherently evil. It's just an accident of how history has shaken out, but racists don't understand history and statistics and ascribe evils to other races. 

There are, of course, Jewish people who are racist. Or Arabs who are racist, or white people who are racist. Some of them have conspiracy/supremacy groups within them, like the Ku Klux Klan.

It wasn't long ago the most white people were open white supremacists in some form, and unfortunately quite a bit still are. Like there's obvious ones in conservatives, but also in liberals who claim that they aren't white supremacists but then defend white supremacism. MLK and Malcolm X had a lot to say about this, pointing out that liberals/""White moderates"" would pretend to care but we're just waiting for any excuse for delegitimizing a protest. 
Martin Luther King wasn't viewed positively by white people until after he was dead. I don't think Malcolm X has ever been viewed positively by white people, or at least a majority of white people.

Like when a few black panthers killed cops (often in self-defense and not cold blood).  Cops had been killing and oppressing black people for over a century, but when black communities defended themselves it was ""terrorism"". And the white liberals would say ""oh I'm all for freedom but not like that"" and withdraw their support for the movement. They were just waiting for an excuse to check out of the movement because their support with mild and limited to begin with.

People still struggle with it today. I personally was born into and raised by a white supremacist family. I was exposed to an explicitly white supremacist curriculum when I was going to a Christian school. For example, in history they taught me that black people weren't capable of governing themselves and Nelson Mandela was wrong to end apartheid in South Africa. They glorified the Confederacy.

But I don't think that all white people are racist or that white people have a racial propensity for racism, even though I have seen it firsthand. Even when it's a majority, it still doesn't define an entire race. 

What we're looking at right now is a snapshot of history rather than the big picture, and in this part of history, a majority of Jews are Jewish supremacists. But already the horrific behavior of Israel has it been opening eyes for a lot of Jewish people not just in the diaspora, but in Israel itself. There were already left wing and even some liberal Jews who were staunchly opposed to the nation of Israel. Also a lot of Orthodox Jews are opposed (from the right wing lol). People are beginning to see Israel for what it is. 

One of the biggest problems I have with the racism is that I know that majority opinions within an ethnic or racial group can change. In contrast, the basic idea of racism is to act like whatever state people are in now, or whatever state we perceive them to be in, is permanent and immutable when it's clear that it's neither of those things. That's why racism sucks, because it seeks to reinforce bad perceptions by denying that the race in question can change, or denying that the people who are racist against them might have a few problems in their preconceived notions about an ever-changing group of people."

I hope this war has shown the importance of free speech to the American left, the people of Palestine, and citizens of countries without a codified first amendment.

----------

There's likely going to be a TikTok ban in the US because of the truths of this war spread on the platform.   Also there's  a free sppech platform  called Rumble popular with the American right, that's getting more popular with the left too as viewpoints get censored. Rumble broadcasts PressTV from Iran as well as other often banned broadcasts like RT.

--------

Rumble is banned in France. France is an antimuslim nation with  a history of banning religious clothing, with recent unrest over an incident at a school.  Freedom of expression is important in all nations.

But I saw something amazing today. While driving to work, I have to pass by a McDonalds. Last night I got an unusual craving for their fries. I didn‚Äôt get them because not supporting major businesses that fund genocide is the very least I can do. 

Driving home from work today, passing by the McDonald‚Äôs, I saw one lone person standing on the sidewalk nearby. She wasn‚Äôt yelling, using offensive language, or doing anything to obstruct daily life. All she did was stand there with a sign reading ‚Äúeveryone deserves freedom üçâ‚Äù and wearing a keffiyeh. In my backwards, red county of all places. 

And just like that, any craving for their food I‚Äôd had disappeared. I waved and smiled and reminded myself to never spend money there again if I can help it. 

Hopefully even if we can‚Äôt be there, small acts of resistance can add up. ‚úåüèº"

This is magnitudes different. This is taking delight in the suffering of innocent men, women, and children. This is knowing that families are starving, and rubbing it in their faces. This is knowing that a mother has lost her baby, yet making fun of her.

One could even argue that It is human to express resentment against someone, out of anger, without thinking - What is utterly inhuman, and inexcusable here is the time taken by these TikTokers to dress-up, film, and post this shit."

The so-called moderates (still fascists) in Israel are going to be looking for a way to blame Netanyahu and pretend it was all him. I don't know how that plays out, but it could be a turning point. In the US, there is likely to be trouble at the Democratic Convention in Chicago. Biden will desperately want to silence that and it probably will go poorly. And then, longer term, there's the US election. If Biden loses, I think it will lead to some serious anger among younger Democrats."
