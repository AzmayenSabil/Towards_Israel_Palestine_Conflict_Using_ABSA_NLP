1d1yfcp,"How do you feel about the idea of ""Pallywood""",l5xnid0,"I once saw a video of a newscaster narrating as ambulance after ambulance passed him carrying injured Civilians to the hospital after an Israeli attack on the West Bank.  

Slowing down the video, it became clear it was the same ambulance, essentially driving around the block.   This was years ago. 

Palliwood is a great nickname."
1d1yfcp,"How do you feel about the idea of ""Pallywood""",l5xivhd,"Hamas uses civilians as human shields for tactical and strategic advantage. 

Tactical advantage includes IDF being unable to easily identify “Islamic resistance” targets. This leads IDF to spend more resources on identifying “Islamic resistance” fighters, infrastructure and otherwise military targets. Israel could take over Gaza in 6 days, as it did in 56 and 67. However, it is fighting terrorists, not an army. Hence, it must spend months selectively targeting “Islamic resistance” targets embedded in the civilian population. Israel could also ignore the rules of armed conflict, and take over Gaza in 3 days, but IDF won’t do it. 

Strategic advantage: 

The “Islamic resistance” is a sophisticated political entity carefully studying and analyzing the situation in the West as well as Israel. Scholars of “Islamic resistance movement” have long argued that it is carefully crafted media plans are also designed to displace other rival factions in the Arab world, Gaza and the West Bank. Their medium term strategy is to take over the West Bank. Their long term strategy is to create an Islamic state in all of Israel, and beyond. 

They are acutely aware of the influence of media on the discourse surrounding the conflict in the West and Middle East. Therefore, it is in their own interest to have as many Palestinian civilians die in IDF operations. 

The “Islamic resistance movement” aren’t fools. They’re a cult of “martyrdom” (which is why we call them a death cult) and evil genociders. But they know what they’re doing. 

They have fooled Israel’s government and entire intelligence community. 

To them, fooling YOU is nothing…"

1d1yfcp,"How do you feel about the idea of ""Pallywood""",l5x8vz4,"Pallywood in my estimation is not real, in so far as deaths are being faked.  What is real, and multiple reporters from respected news organizations have said this, is Hamas limiting as much footage of dead combatants as possible. So, in every operation Israel has had with Hamas, you almost only ever see footage of dead civilians. For example reporters have been ordered to shut off cameras when combatants are coming into the morgue but they're allowed to show as much footage of dead civilians as possible. Matt Friedman, previously with AP in Jerusalem, said that Hamas broke into the AP offices in Gaza City, and intimidated staff not report on their activities. There was a rocket launch just outside their offices and it never got reported."

1d25dh1,The curse of the 8th decade,l5ylwbz,">Many religious people in Israel fear this prophecy because no Jewish state has lasted more than 80 years.

As someone that knows a lot of religious people (and as someone that is one) this is a bad take. Religious jews are (usually) not cavemen"
1d25dh1,The curse of the 8th decade,l5z5jet,"Hamas likes inventing Jewish religious beliefs. The fact that they get so much traction shows how little people actual know about Judaism and Jews.

The first reference I know to a ""curse of the eighth decade"" comes from an Abu Obeida [statement](https://www.palestinechronicle.com/be-confident-our-people-this-is-what-abu-obeida-said-in-latest-statement/) in late October:

>The era of Zionism’s decline has begun, and the curse of the eighth decade will befall them. (Repeated warnings by Israeli politicians that Israel might not live past its eight decades.)

Other pro-Hamas [sources](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20231128-the-israeli-curse-of-the-eighth-decade-could-have-ramifications-across-the-middle-east/) insist that it ""haunts the Israeli mind"" or that Israelis are obsessed with it, yet I'm certain that 95% of Israelis have never heard of the supposed curse. The other 5% know the concept from anti-Israel propaganda.

If you search for it on the Jewish stack exchange, for example, you'll get [zero results](https://judaism.stackexchange.com/search?q=Curse+eighth+decade).

It's like how anti-Zionists suddenly became obsessed with the idea that Israelis were secretly preparing red cows so they could destroy the al-Aqsa Mosque. Once again, it originated with an Abu Obeida [speech](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-war-hamas-red-heifers-from-texas-jerusalem-jewish-temple-al-aqsa/) and had no connection to reality.

Rather than saying anything about Israelis, these talking points show how much of the pro-Palestinian movement is really pro-Hamas. They listen to Hamas's propaganda, accept it unquestiongly, and amplify it over and over."

1d25dh1,The curse of the 8th decade,l5yjp02,"I had never heard of this curse until I saw this post, and now that I've read about it the whole idea feels like it has anti-zionist fanfic vibes.

me supporting palestine as a woman and a christian and bisexual is like being chicken for chick-fil-a.

pro-pally people are insufferable leftists that I would feel ashamed to be associated with even if I was a lefty

pro-pally people have said jihadi speak in arbaic that translates too ""the gates of al-auqsa can only be opened by a maytr.""

pro-pally people are bringing back the big nose jew stereotype.

I don't care about kids dying in a war they themselves started, kids die all the time due to conflicts, shit kids are starving to death in lesser countries, literally haven't seen these watermelon heads rally to end hunger. its not  my responsiblity as an american either, and if palestine wants to be a big boy state then they should be responible for their own kids. how much is there antics gonna cost me as a tax payer? we got homeless vets mentally ill people disabled people women with kids whole ass families homeless on the fucking streets but fuck them amirite? kids are dying 1000s of mile away

3. One Palestinian UWNRA dude saying it is genocide after it was revealed that UWNRA people are also Hamas .

1d2bpxp,Why I am Pro-Palestine and anti-genocide (all the evidence I've collected),l61hhf2,"The ""Hamas was supported by Israel/Benjamin Netanyahu and it blew up in their face"" talking point is so strange to me, because they are trying to paint Israel in a negative light until you think about it for more than a few seconds.

Israel supported Hamas in the 90s because they were the least extreme political group at the time whose ideology focused more on charity than political violence. It wasn't until later in the decade that Hamas started using car bombs and suicide bombers, thanks to the work of bombmaker Yahya Abd-al-Latif Ayyash (The Engineer). Granted, the uptick in violence was in response to a massacre by a Zionist extremist, but nevertheless, the consisten use of suicide bombers in public places led to strict border security and the isolation of Gaza. 

Israel's actions with regards to Hamas were done to appease them, that includes allowing Gazans to work in Israel and an infusion of cash from Qatar, all done to prevent the Gaza economy from collapsing. Keep in mind, Hamas was still firing rockets into Israel. 

Israel was literally trying to help Gazan children and save them from starving by allowing their anti-Semitic government get aid money and work permits. It's exactly what these anti-Zionist protestors would have wanted them to do, yet Hamas still carried out their military operation on Oct 7. 

It's basically victim blaming Israel. Hamas still chose to use their resources to construct tunnels, rocket launchers, and conduct terrorist attacks against Israel instead of improving the lives of their citizens. Anti-Zionists still have the gall to blame Israel for Hamas's actions. If Israel hadn't propped up the Gaza government or if they conducted a pre-emptive strike on Oct 6, I'm willing to bet the Anti-Zionists would have been more hostile."

The reason it’s only 25 percent is because they don’t want to border a state ruled by Hamas, who openly and proudly call for geonocide against Jews and the obliteration of Israel- and repeatedly attacks Israel.  

Historically since 1935, there have been at least 5 attempts  at a 2 state solution—- and each time the Palestinian leadership rejected it- and then responded by attacking Israel again and again. That’s why Israel had to  deploy an Iron Dome defense system  since 2011. 

I’m 2000 , Bill Clinton, with the endorsement  in advance by Barak, outlined the main points of a future settlement. The proposals included the establishment of a demilitarised Palestinian state on some 92% of the West Bank and 100% of the Gaza Strip, with some territorial compensation for the Palestinians from pre-1967 Israeli territory; the dismantling of most of the settlements and the concentration of the bulk of the settlers inside the 8% of the West Bank to be annexed by Israel; the establishment of the Palestinian capital in east Jerusalem, in which some Arab neighborhoods would become sovereign Palestinian territory and others would enjoy ""functional autonomy""; Palestinian sovereignty over half the Old City of Jerusalem (the Muslim and Christian quarters) and ""custodianship,"" though not sovereignty, over the Temple Mount; a return of refugees to the prospective Palestinian state , and the organization by the international community of a massive aid programme to facilitate the refugees' rehabilitation.

1) That Israel might not achieve it's goal of removing Hamas and returning the hostages - like you said  
2) That Israel can't afford (not financially, but conceptually) another war with the Palestinians, unless a radical shift in public opinion happen.

Both of these things together are pretty depressing, since if Israel doesn't achieve it's goals, there would almost surely be another small scale or large scale war in a few years - and it looks more and more like Israel is not going to achieve it's goals.

There is no ""back"", Israel hadn't controlled the region until that point in time, unlike the Gaza Strip which it briefly occupied in 1956. 

> What legal right do Palestinians have to ALL of Judea and Samaria that it can be called an occupied territory? Spoiler: None.

I know people dislike Wikipedia but this article has plenty of good scholarly sources that go over this topic. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_the_Israeli_occupation_of_Palestine

> What is Israel’s legal right? This is where the UN Charter comes in.

> The UN Charter
In 1945, after World War II, the UN was established. Its charter contains a crucial clause for the Jewish people. The powers decided to transition from the mandate system to a new system called “Trusteeship.”
Article 80 of Chapter 12 of the UN Charter ensures that the rights of peoples under the mandates remain valid. When the UN Charter came into effect, it included Article 80, which preserves the rights of peoples under all decisions from 1917 to 1946.

> This article recognise the Jewish people’s rights to Israel, including Judea and Samaria. (Balfour Declaration, The Mandate For Palestine, San Remo Conference..)

Thats not what it is, Mandatory Palestine remained a mandate until the very end, it's not like Mandates were all transformed into UN trust territories. For example in Somaliland which was formerly ruled by Italians, following the end of British administration there after World War 2 it became the [trust territory of somaliland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_Territory_of_Somaliland). This only happened to select regions not all Mandates, certainly not Mandatory Palestine. Directly from the UN charter:

""It will be a matter for subsequent agreement as to which territories in the foregoing categories will be brought under the trusteeship system and upon what terms.""

""The terms of trusteeship for each territory to be placed under the trusteeship system, including any alteration or amendment, shall be agreed upon by the states directly concerned, including the mandatory power in the case of territories held under mandate by a Member of the United Nations, and shall be approved as provided for in Articles 83 and 85.""
(https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter/chapter-12)

None of that happened with Palestine. I don't really care what rights Israel may or may not have to the West Bank, though. Even if we were to agree that Israel and only Israel has an indisputable right to the West Bank, how do you think an annexation would work demographically? Jews would not keep their political majority."
1d1xrv8,The Legal Right of The Jewish People To The Land of Israel ,l5zrapn,"I can't see what your actual argument is here.

The Balfour Declaration and the text of the Mandate document promise a National Home for the Jews in Palestine; the diplomats obviously knew the word 'state' and chose not to use it. 'Trust me bro they meant a state' is not an argument and is a real weak point of your reasoning here.

Your argument about the partition plan seems to be 'I don't want Palestinians to be entitled to a state, therefore the Partition Plan cannot confer entitlement to a state'. This isn't a valid argument. Start with the facts and see where they lead, rather than reasoning backwards from the conclusions you want.

In terms of the UN trusteeship I don't know why that's present at all, actually.

I think you're missing some of the crucial arguments here. National independence movements that are subsequently recognised internationally are themselves sufficient legal basis: international recognition is what endorses the state.

The problem you have, since you approach this politically rather than objectively, is that this implies that international recognition of a Palestinian state endorses that too, and I suspect you don't want to believe that.

If you keep working on your writing, and I hope you do, you might like to consider where the legal borders of Israel really lie and what that implies about Israelis living outside those borders."
1d1xrv8,The Legal Right of The Jewish People To The Land of Israel ,l5wygan,">Consider this from another perspective: if the legal right of the Jewish people to this land came from the Partition Plan, it would mean that the Palestinians have a legal right not only to the West Bank and Gaza but also to parts of modern Israel. 

I disagree. The Arabs rejected the partition plan. Therefore it is no longer valid, which is why the Green Line is considered ""Proper Israel"" - despite being larger then the UN's suggestion. 

The only valid part that UN resolution 181 gave is validating the right of the Jewish people to establish a state in the region formerly known as Palestine. It gave Israel legitimacy. The borders don't matter, since one party rejected them."

But they touch on some points you made here, which is that in any armed conflict, women and girls (they specify “girls” for particular reasons, but I would venture to say young children / children in general) are disproportionately affected. This is true in any conflict, largely due to sexual violence and additional or subsequent reproductive health issues, as well as that mothers are the ones most often caring for children, and will bear the responsibility of managing their families and their family’s safety during active conflicts. 

This is true in any conflict. The plight of women in Gaza and also the female victims of sexual assault from October 7 as well as the current female hostages are examples from this conflict. But all throughout history, even dating back to more ancient times, it has been the same. Yet despite the fact that women often have to live through some of the most awful acts of war, hardly ever are they in positions of power where they could influence decisions regarding war and peace.

Since October 7th, the BBC has issued FIVE apologies for spreading disinformation about Israel. Despite the apologies, each claim was rooted in antisemitic tropes and libels that caused irreversible damage after being released.

The place of execution of senior Hamas officials in Rafah is near UNRWA warehouses in the west of the city - areas 2371 and 2372 - more than a kilometer away from the safe zone.

And this is in contrast to the Palestinians claims that the IDF bombing was in the safe zone (they cannot utter a word without lying!

Usually if there is a real casualty there are no cameras. It’s also pretty insane to think how many people are in on these tricks. They also dress up as Israeli soldiers with guns which is awful and get people to pose as supposed civilian Israelís. All this leads us to believe that the iDF is horrendous.

The original mandate for Britain opened both Palestine and Transjordan to Jewish refugees. The British then closed Jordan to Jews, and banned land sales there. Then, after the Arab leaders started a civil war in 1936, the British decided to take more land off the table, leaving the Jews with almost nothing. 

The Peel commission also kept Jerusalem British. 


The peel commission plan was obviously not going to stick, and it was largely seen as a temporary solution, which the Jews could live with. 

Therefore, the Jewish leadership accepted it."

>In 1936, after years of massacres against Jews by Arabs and during the Arab Revolt, the British decided it was time to find a solution. They investigated and reached their conclusions in the Peel Commission. They recommended a plan for two states for two peoples: About 17% of the land would go to the Jewish state About 75% of the land would go to the Arab state The rest would remain under British control. What was the Arabs’ response? Immediate rejection. The Zionist movement did not agree to the plan as it was but called for peace talks based on it

Even the British rejected the Peel Commission on grounds that it was impracticable due to ""political, administrative and financial difficulties"". Why should the Arabs accept a plan even the British (who wanted to get out as soon as possible) found to be problematic?

>In summary, within 10 years, a bi-national state would be established with Arabs making up about two-thirds of the population and Jews one-third. There would be no more Jewish immigration, and Jews would be limited to purchasing only 5% of the land, with 95% allocated to Arabs. What was the Arabs’ response? Immediate rejection.

This is not true. Many accepted the deal like Jamal Al-Husayni (the Mufti's relative) and Musa Al-Alami. In fact,  Hajj Amin al-Husayni initially ""astonished"" the other members of the Arab Higher Committee by turning down the White Paper. Out of all the Palestinian Arab leaders I know who were present, the Mufti was the only one who rejected the deal.

Continued with your blog...

>**1**. More than 50% of the Jewish state’s territory was undeveloped desert, for example; the Negev, which was state-owned by the British – and this is my next point.

False, the proposed Jewish state contained the rich urban Gush Dan valley, most of the Galilee, one of the most fertile urban areas, the Sea of Galilee (the largest freshwater lake in Palestine), and even the Negev granted access to the Red Sea International trade. In fact, Zionist leaders had advocated for years resettling the Negev as it provided ample land for Jewish settlements. If getting the Negev was as bad as you say, why did the Zionists actively campaigned for it?

Many countries were giving aid including Egypt in which drivers were fearing for their lives as they drove through and were getting pelted by rocks that would shatter the windshields potentially hitting them to stop the trucks and even reports that they pulled an Egyptian out of the truck and beat him. It’s risky. But on top of that Egypt has restricted aid going through to Rafah because they profit from the situation.

There’s a lot happening here that’s taking advantage of the Gazans suffering but Israel is doing its part in lessening it. You would NOT see the same treatment if the positions were opposite.

The aid at the pier, stolen by Hamas. What more can Israel do?

Said piece of land is actually of not particularly great value and is a headache to rule because it does not have a lot natural resources and because it is situated in the middle of a volatile historical conflict zone that has been fought over by the various powers that have ben situated in modern day Egypt, Turkey, and Iran since the dawn of human civilization and is also on the Mediterranean Sea meaning random European powers can also attack it.

- Around 400 trucks of aid go through to Gaza every day through Israel alone. The limit is logistical, no more trucks can enter.
- Egypt decided to stop all aid to Gaza so every aid coming in today is by Israel.
- Along with that, hundreds of commercial trucks go through Kerem Shalom to Gaza to complement the aid.

So Israel is doing whatever it can to provide aid and still gets criticized as if it does not give it at all. What would one think of it if not bias against Israel?

# Israel is not a bad country

When we look at Israel objectively, we see that:

Israel is in the top 13% when it comes to democracy: [Democracy Index - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index)

Has the most Freedom of Religion in the region, well above global average: [Freedom of religion Index](https://govdata360.worldbank.org/indicators/hd6a18526?country=ISR&indicator=41930&countries=ARE,KWT,QAT,MLT,BHR,SAU,OMN,LBN,LBY,IRQ,JOR,PSE,DZA,DJI,TUN,EGY,MAR,IRN,SYR,YEM&viz=line_chart&years=1975,2020&compareBy=region)

Israel is in the top 22% of countries for Freedom of Expression: [Freedom of Expression Index](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/freedom-of-expression-index?tab=table) 

Top 30% in terms of Civil Rights and Freedom: [Freedom House- Freedom in the World Index](https://freedomhouse.org/countries/freedom-world)

And Israel even ranks in top 30% in terms of “Good Countries”: [The Good Country Index](https://index.goodcountry.org/)



# Israel receives the most amount of negative attention

Yet with a mere 10 million in population, Israel is also the country that receives more UN condemnations per year than all other countries combined.

Israel is the only country that has a boycott campaign against it.

Several UN member states don't recognize Israel's existence, and some of these states have even vowed Israel's destruction.



# The Israeli Palestinian conflict isn't a severe one

If we talk about the conflict with Palestine; this current round of fighting is very telling.

I spent most of my career as an Officer in the British Army, and have deployed to two separate continents for combat operations. On top of that, I've been behind the training, logistics and operations of a large range of combat operations, including Afghanistan, and Iraq.

This current round of fighting in Gaza has involved over 250 hostages taken from Israel (130+ remain in Gaza to this day), over 29 thousand rockets fired at Israel, and of course one of the most brutal, and by far the most recorded, massacre in recent history. Any of these three facts should be justification enough for any country to invade and remove the terror organization responsible. To add to this, to anyone with military knowledge it's extremely clear that Israel is doing everything it can to prevent civilian casualties. A 1:1.5 combatant to civilian casualty ratio is nothing short of a miracle, as I would have expected something closer to 1:8 for an arena like Gaza.

There are currently 54 ongoing armed conflicts. 18 of these are more severe, in terms of deaths, than the Israeli Palestinian conflict. Yet almost none of these are being accused of ""Genocide"", are causing protests or are even getting attention at the UN or in international media.

lol why don't you blame Qatar for sending money to Hamas? Why is it Israel's fault. Who has agency in this scenario?"
1d1ja2p,It is disingenuous to pretend that Israel has ever cared about Palestinians over the last 20 yrs,l5v7nrh,"The first claim about Israel pulling out of Gaza in a disingenuous way - I honestly don't know what do you think contradicts the idea that Israel wanted the Palestinians to have a better economy and less friction to make terror less likely. Yes, Israel continued with security measures, as without them at that time there would likely be tons of terror attacks on Israel, as were before the disengagement. Ideologies don't simply go away in a day. What Israel thought, and this is documented both in testimonies, and in public speeches is that after the disengagement the Palestinians would stop or decrease the terror ideologies, and then Israel could lift the security measures. It unfortunately didn't happen. I would add in order not to mislead anyone - Israel's PM at that time was aware that this might not work, and that it could go either way, just that he thought in both cases it's for the better of Israel not to have the settlers around. 

The second claim - Kind of feels like cherry picking and ignoring timelines. If you actually read about why this person said those things - in the 80s Hamas was perceived as the more pragmatic out of the Palestinian Factions, and the one that Israel could actually negotiate a settlement with. Yes, secular terrorism exists as well, and at that time, the non-Hamas terrorists were scarier. Was Israel wrong? maybe, we don't have access to the counterfactual, it could also be the case where things would go far worse. 

Moreover, I have no idea why do you pick the easy cases. For instance, a clear policy that Israel does in order to improve the Palestinian economy is taking in Palestinians workers. notice that Israel could get better and cheaper labor from many other countries, as it does in areas further away from the Palestinian territories, but it doesn't. Why?   
You could make the claim that it's not for the Palestinian's favor, and Israel just want less terror for themselves, and for some people in Israel I'm sure it's true - but it's hard to deny that Israel worked and works to improve the Palestinian economy and providing aid etc."

Kinda hard to care about a people who've been trying to genocide you for over a century.. or millennia depending on the cultural aspect you want to look at..

Still, Israel has done quite a bit to assist Palestinians over the years in hopes that is will make the population less genocidal towards Jews..  The most known project, because of the war, was the expansion of Al-Shifa..

1d1ja2p,It is disingenuous to pretend that Israel has ever cared about Palestinians over the last 20 yrs,l5vqfju,It’s silly to try to make statements about what Israel “cares” about. Israel is a complex place filled with people and government members with vastly different politics and values. They all care about different things. Just like everywhere else.
1d1ja2p,It is disingenuous to pretend that Israel has ever cared about Palestinians over the last 20 yrs,l5v1ln6,"Israel allowed money to go from Qatar to Gaza … 

1. Israel does not control the banks or the money  
2. Certain private companies have been blocking crypto in this manner where they can
3. If Israel DID somehow block money going to Gaza would it not be called an occupation apartheid genocide? 
4. But it’s called that anyway so what exactly do you want? 

Basically you’re doing the thing where Israel/jews are damned if they do and damned if they don’t, which makes Israelis want the government to do the bad things because we would get blamed for doing bad things anyway whether we do it or not. 

Example: they pulled out of Gaza but it wasn’t actually an extension of an olive branch, it was a sneaky move by the Jews to do some other agenda (which you didn’t even explain what you think this agenda is). 

Ok so we might as well take Gaza back then right? Because nobody appreciates that we moved ourselves out of there so why wouldn’t we take it and turn it into a giant resort water park since nobody cares what we do with it either way it’s apartheid genocide colonizer whatever. Might as well make it benefit ourselves then right?"

The declaration conveniently doesn't mention what happens to Jews who don't wish to move and don't want to renounce Zionism but I think we all know the answer without it being stated."
1d1q0zn,What do people think of Tomorrow’s Palestine — A Declaration ?,l5vhbna,"First off you should link to this declaration in your post, I'd edit to add the link.  I think you mean: https://odsi.co/en/statements/declaration-tomorrows-palestine-signatories/

Which is the One Democratic State proposal on which there are probably about 20 posts if you look at the history.  In general I think it is better than most other declarations but I'll note a few points which are clearly objectionable:

> the right of Palestinian refugees to return and extends Palestinian citizenship to all Jews who were born in Palestine, who have broken free from Zionism and who wish to remain in it as Palestinians. 

So we are going to have a Palestine where a certain group of people have rights as a matter of race (original Palestinians?) and Jews would have rights as a matter of sufferance if they are deemed to have ""broken free from Zionism"".  Sounds a lot like the tradiitional Muslim/Christian declarations where converts have lots of rights but ethnic Jews who still practice Judaism do not.  Basically this is Ferdinand and Isabella's position.

> A democratic state, a state for all its citizens with no discrimination on the basis of religion, ethnicity, culture, language, sex or gender, 

Well that of course contradicts the initial claim about a state where one group of residents have racial rights and the others are granted sufferance.  Moreover the religious discrimination is explicit and open. 

> a pluralistic, free and progressive society 

Palestinians have shown no interest in creating this where they have the capacity to do so.  Create this in Area-A today. 

> A state that frees popular classes from poverty, unemployment and marginalization and guarantees free quality education, social security and workers’ rights.

Israelis would probably be fine with this.  To me rights can only be negative rights (the right not to have XYZ done to you). 
Guarantees of positive rights, like  economic rights mean a right to take from others.  For their to be quality education their need to be educators.  That sounds like a formula for coercion.  But again Israel itself still has most of these rights. 


> A state of law, that criminalizes Zionism by law while ensuring the rights of all without exception. 

Well the right of the state to punish thought crime.  Which is a rather big exception.

> Thoughts?

Sounds like the statement of purpose for a totalitarian racist dictatorship."

1d1q0zn,What do people think of Tomorrow’s Palestine — A Declaration ?,l5vnqq3,"This is nice fanfiction, I bet the jihadist islamist groups (with a majority of Palestinians backing them) will certainly form a democratic, secular, socially just state."
1d1q0zn,What do people think of Tomorrow’s Palestine — A Declaration ?,l5vzb6k,"I think that statement is advocating for ethnic cleansing of Jews and pretends to be forward thinking. 

Why is this so hard for Palestinians to agree with:

“The Jewish people around the world and Palestinian people around the world are both indigenous to the Land of Israel/Palestine and therefore have an equal and legitimate right to settle and live anywhere in the Land of Israel/Palestine, but given the desire of both peoples to a sovereign state that would reflect their unique culture and history, we believe in sharing the land between a Jewish state, Israel, and an Arab state, Palestine, that would allow them each to enjoy dignity and sovereignty in their own national home. Neither Israel nor Palestine should be exclusively for the Jewish and Palestinian people respectively and both should accommodate minorities of the other people.”"
1d1q0zn,What do people think of Tomorrow’s Palestine — A Declaration ?,l5vnx3c,So basically create an Israel that is just called Palestine that is dominated by Palestinians instead of Jews?
1d1q0zn,What do people think of Tomorrow’s Palestine — A Declaration ?,l5vqryq,"Posts like this convince me that there won’t be peace for a long time to come, because most Palestinians and their supporters still refuse to recognize the majority of the world’s Jews as being descended from Israelite exiles and therefore indigenous to the Levant.

If Palestinians wanted a unified state together with the Jews and the refugees of the Jewish diaspora, they had decades to propose one before the UN was forced to step in with a partition in 1947."

This will literally never work

Why would Israel agree to this? They are the stronger of the two entities, who have no plan to get rid of their statehood, Zionist or not"
1d1q0zn,What do people think of Tomorrow’s Palestine — A Declaration ?,l5vn9p2,"May I ask how is this “Tomorrow’s Palestine” planning to remain secular, democratic, and prevent a rise of Islamic (i dont know what you want to call it… Islamic fundamendalist ? Islamic terrorism, Islamic extremism, Islamic jihadist etc…) like experienced in many other muslim states ? 

Muslim brotherhood in Egypt, Al-Qaeda, Taliban in Afghanistan, Ayatollah in Islamic Republic, Houthi in Yemen, Boko Haremin Nigeria, etc…. these organizations did not pop up due to Israel or has anything to do with Israel…(just putting it out there…with or without Israel…. islamic jihadist are rampant in many muslim countries)

These 20,000 Palestinian signatories, are they even Palestinian citizens with Palestinian passport, citizenship and residing in Palestine ? If I use an estimate for the population of Palestinians (Gaza + West Bank) an estimate say 5 million.  That’s only a 0.4% representation of the Palestinian people… if this is going to be democratic, shouldnt more Palestinians be consulted ? Why not form a political party in Palestine and go for elections, that way this “Tomorrow’s Palestine” party (if they win) will have the mandate and support of the majority (not just 0.4%) of the Palestinian population. 

Is this an envisioning of a western liberal democratic Palestine state ? So LGBTQ will be accepted, marriage equality, in this Tomorrow’s Palestine ?

May i ask is there an example of this kind of Tomorrow Palestine state in the muslim world ?"

It works very very very well. I can guarantee a lot of studies will look into how effective this has been for hamas. Ask yourself why the genocide in Sudan is getting no coverage."
1d0cfza,Behavior of Pro-Palestine folks v Pro-Israel folks,l5msxif,"I’ve personally encountered a good variety of opinions on this sub, more so than in my day to day. But, I don’t think there’s a good measure bc grouping people is near impossible since we’re all self identifying and it’s pretty fluid dependent on who you’re talking to. Like you can be extremely critical of Israel but then when you’re talking with someone who thinks Israel shouldn’t exist your position shifts to pro-Israel even if you’d call yourself pro-Palestine. 

For me personally, the most memorable arguments come from people who think differently and however I classify their stance is perhaps not how they’d categorize themselves. 

It’s also this intersection of maximalist thinking and subjective/qualitative measures. Like someone will present an opinion as fact. Or, and this is day to day life not necessarily related specifically to I/P, but having a discussion with someone who names five things as the most evil. For me “most” is singular, by context, I assume for them it is a degree of evilness, those are different things. But I think that stuff factors into the discussions here. I think when you have a lot of opinion as a basis for debate without quantitative measures or static definitions it devolves into emotional hyperbole. 

In my day to day I also find that not a lot of people break down their opinions into smaller logical steps. Sometimes when you work that angle it’s easier to have conversations bc you’re not talking about a single conclusion but about smaller more manageable opinions. Then you can be on a step and relate it to one of your own opinions.

I do think the people who are physically unable to agree to disagree are the worst."
1d0cfza,Behavior of Pro-Palestine folks v Pro-Israel folks,l5n34kz,"The number of anti Israel comments on this thread alone proves that the sub isn’t an echo chamber. It’s true that most regulars are pro Israel, that’s because anti Israel people are anti free speech. Any anti Israel sub would ban or otherwise discriminate against anyone pro Israel. This is actually a major problem on Reddit in general, where you have high profile subs banning people for merely commenting on Jewish subs on subs like Jewish or Israel. 

I also tend to agree with the point that a lot of anti Israel people are pro Hamas. Every time someone brings up Hamas, people very often justify it as resistance or whatever. Also, the call for ceasefire benefits Hamas and to “end the blockade”, which would remain in power."
1d0cfza,Behavior of Pro-Palestine folks v Pro-Israel folks,l5ok46w,"'Pro-Palestine' arguments tend to revolve around emotional outrage, because the entire culture and discourse is not rooted in critical thinking.

If you condemn Israel for trying to get back their hostages and eliminate an internationally recognized terrorist organization, without even reflecting on the harm this terrorist organization has done, then you are absolutely without a doubt supporting them in the realm of public opinion. 

But the truth is the people protesting go further than that. They don't just hold a kumbaya why can't we all get along position. They hold an anti western position that actively condones and supports the actions of any group or nation they see as sharing a common western enemy.

1d1972j,"I am yet to hear a non-racist justification for calling all anti war protest ""pro Hamas marches""",l5smlzg,"Any promotion of “ceasefire now” is benefitting Hamas, intentionally or not. That’s it, pretty cut & dry. Everything they do benefits Hamas. Now that’s not to say they are necessarily “pro Hamas” just for that reason, but unless the tag line of protest is “ceasefire now, with a plan to completely & permanently dismantle Hamas” it is for all intents and purposes a “pro Hamas march”"
1d1972j,"I am yet to hear a non-racist justification for calling all anti war protest ""pro Hamas marches""",l5suci5,"1) So, not that I'm comparing or anything, but are you familiar with the saying about 100 people who march with 10 people who belong to a certain German group and what does it say about the 100 people? Even if it's a small but loud minority, the fact that this minority is being endorsed rather than shunned and condemned by the other protestors says something. And this is without even talking about the antisemitic things that happened in some of the protests (such as attacking synagogues) and the lack of response from the protest organizers. 

2) You're claiming that it is a small number of individuals who fit the description pro-Hamas. I honestly don't know the proportions everywhere, from what I've seen, it's not that small. Perhaps it's convenient for you to think that it's a minority, but what are you basing it upon? Just as supportive evidence of why I think that the percentage might be higher, besides all of the videos and things - have you looked at polling among young people on the subject? young people are wayyy overrepresented in these protests.

  
3) Moreover, if we look at specific central location for protests such as the Columbia encampment, it's hard to say that the protest there is not pro-Hamas. They constantly chant violent slogans that call for intifada, and even chants like 'no god buy Allah, and the Shahid is beloved by god'. There were literally signs in the encampment saying ""We support Hamas"", or the more reasonable, but still pro-Hamas - (something like, don't remember the exact) ""If you support our corpses and not our rockets you don't belong here"". Notice that the encampment was celebrated both by outside protestors, and protestors all over the US or even the world. So, central protests are showing clear pro-Hamas views.

4) It's not only central protests, it's also the major organizers of the protests. If you go to the website of SJP for example - their ideas are not far from Hamas', minus the Sharia law. It's not only in the US, there were articles on direct links between prominent organizers of protests in the UK and Hamas. If you really care about it, I can try to find the article myself.  So in many cases, the people who organize these protests are clearly pro-Hamas.

5) In the messaging that these protests are sending to the public - as a policy they aren't willing to condemn Hamas. This is the weakest of all points, but perhaps they are doing it cause they know that they would make a lot of the people they represent angry (just like the video from last month of a speaker in a protest, saying something against Hamas and booed off stage)

6) Adding this, one of the most prominent chants of the protests is 'resistance is justified when people are occupied'. - this is pretty pro-Hamas IMO, cause it tries to paint Hamas' actions as legitimate resistance. 

  
So we have protests with unknown number of Pro-Hamas supporters, that even if we don't agree on the percentage, we can agree that they are extremely loud voice inside these protests. The organizers of the protests, as well as some of the most central protests show wide support for Hamas, often in explicit ways, and sometimes just support for violent resistance against Israelis - both in the protests themselves, and in messaging to the public.  Moreover, regardless of how small the minority is, they are at best ignored, and at worst endorsed by the other protestors. This is why I think it's fair to call these protests pro-Hamas. correct me if you think I'm wrong, but I don't think I was racist in my opinion.  
  
  
To be fair, I think you can protest just the war, and I'm sure there are some, and perhaps even a majority that's mostly there because of the war. some don't have a clue what is Hamas, others are undecided on the issue, and some explicitly don't support Hamas. However, given all I've written, and how the majority of these people react to active support of Hamas, I don't think that they change how we should address these protests."
1d1972j,"I am yet to hear a non-racist justification for calling all anti war protest ""pro Hamas marches""",l5tdc06,"""Free Palestine"" and ""Ceasefire Now"" seem to be coming out of the same mouths.  So let's examine this.  Freeing Palestine appears to only be freeing themselves of Israel, not Hamas.  So in effect, those that shout ""Free Palestine"" give Hamas agency to act as freedom fighters.

It is noteworthy that many demanding a ""ceasefire"" were also cheering on Iranian missiles.  Take that as you may."

Not in my economy, not in my society, and certainly not in my sight. An international force needs to be put in place to de-radicalise Palestinian society, in a similar manner to 1940s Germany.

As an Israeli taxpayer I will not contribute a single cent to rebuild Gaza. Arab countries or others with an interest in doing so are more than welcome to foot the bill and exert their influence in it. If this independent entity so much as breathes in the wrong direction, we as Israelis have the right to respond in any way we see fit."
1d0ufty,Questions for the sub on peace process and dialoging?,l5pr9eb,"If you could ""make changes to society"" we would not have the problem in the first place.  The Palestinians would simply convert to Judaism, make Alia and annex the Palestinian territories. In order to come to a solution you have to work with the people you find, not the society as you would like to see it.

What has to change is not necessarily the general mindset, what is needed is more pragmatism. On the Palestinian side that means giving up futile hopes of a ""right of return"" and presumably acceptance of not getting any part of Jerusalem for their state. Those ships sailed in 1948/2000. On the Israeli side it would first and foremost means that they will have to come to terms with a solution in which certain individuals will essentially be rewarded (despite Palestinians overall suffering on balance) for murdering Jews and that at some point the option of claiming all of the ancestral Jewish homeland for Israel will be precluded."
1d0ufty,Questions for the sub on peace process and dialoging?,l5pwenl,"1. Peace requires pre-conditions before it'll be possible.

2. Generally speaking to an Israeli in all Arab states & Palestine proper is a criminal offense. If you're doing it one on one and making small waves you'll get away with it. If you start promoting it or making 'big waves' you'll get the iron boot of the authorities."

1d0ufty,Questions for the sub on peace process and dialoging?,l5pouzu,"Just my personal opinion:

It has never worked out to leave the Palestinians alone. They always continue attacking Israel. So it is currently not possible to give them their own state if we really want to have peace.

The best solution is to finally win this war, occupying Gaza and start a denacification as done in Germany. It has to be controlled that no nazi ideology or islamistic ideology is taught in school. Society has to be rebuilt so that it is not focused on antisemitism and Islamic terrorism. Money has to be spent to build an infrastructure and economy, not invested into the war against Israel. If this process is done, there can be Palestine.

If Israel is again being forced to stop the attacks, there can't be peace. The status quo will continue, and actually, that would be the second best option for Israel. 

There can't be a 1ss, as Palestinians want to kill all jews, so they should not be part of a Jewish state.

Oh, the last option is that the Palestinians are able to kill all jews there and create an Islamic terror state. It's not my favorite option, though.."
1d0ufty,Questions for the sub on peace process and dialoging?,l5pn2rb,"Before I answer, let me remind you that the ones who hold all the cards are the Israelis. It doesn't matter what the Palestinians want unless Israelis and their backers want a compromise.

You can't have a 2 state solution if getting recognised as a state means Israel gets to steal your Tax revenue as Smotrich has done.

You can't promote peace while the US threatens to defund the PA if their plea for justice to international courts, nets results.



I would love to see a 1ss. It's the only consistent moral position in my opinion. The 2ss has become nothing but a way for Israel to steal more lands and build more settlements. 

I am not a Palestinian but my interactions with Israelis online have mostly been negative. I had good conversations with a few of them though even some zionists too. 


I am aware that I shouldn't judge based on what I see online. The internet brings out the worst in people."

The products need to be tested once in a while."

1d0ufty,Questions for the sub on peace process and dialoging?,l5scire,"Agreed - but I want to further stress the point that Israel should absolutely not be the sole owner of the territory. Gaza needs to be rebuilt and deradicalized, not oppressed further. 

As for the West Bank, clear borders need to be drawn to stop Israeli encroachment, and settlers need to be held to a much higher standard."
1d0ufty,Questions for the sub on peace process and dialoging?,l5t9y0j,"I would support greater involvement from the US but I just don't think the political will for boots on the ground is there, not after Iraq and Afghanistan. Peter Zeihan talks about this trend a lot where American foreign policy is becoming increasingly isolationist. For now, I think the scope of US involvement will just be aid in the form military equipment. Thus far, I haven't seen any evidence that the moderate Arab states are willing to lead a Marshal plan either, or at least, they seem unwilling to administer Gaza on the day after."
