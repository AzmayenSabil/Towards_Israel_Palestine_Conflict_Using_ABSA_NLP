1ch52y7,You will never convince an Israeli they are a White Colonizer that needs to go back to Poland.,l208p8q,"Israel exists and isn't going anywhere.

The only thing that would be productive is for people to stop pretending gluing Gaza and West Bank together somehow creates ""Palestine.""

Gaza and West Bank don't get along, aren't connected geographically, and have completely different governments that would kill each other if they could.

If you want to be productive, convince West Bank to negotiate terms for a recognized state with Israel that has no connection to Gaza. Israel will gladly trade land for peace as it always has when possible."

Regardless, it’s a stupid saying to any Jewish person, even Ashkenazi Jews from Europe. Most polish Jews died in the Holocaust, most polish refugees didn’t end up in Israel. If they’re telling polish jews to go back to Poland from America, I have news to the Arab and non Jewish land squatters there."

The palastine subreddit is truely shocking

The above is a post.

The level hatred and auful advice is chilling

Interestingly when I was looking through all the posts I was shocked that there was a single comment challenging anything

Everything was entirely on point and utterly partizan. 

I posted a polite comment in one thread just asking was there a reason why there was do discussion or varied views. My. Comment was deleted. In 3.mins and I got a message from the admin saying. I had broken group guidelines and was permimently banned

Is this allowed on a public forum? It just seems like complete propoganda to make people think everyone agrees with the message so it would be very hard to challenge anything. 

It also looks like most of the posts are from young people or those that seem to have skin in the game and a sort of mentoring

It is really quite scarry if this is the future"

1ch8b2r,The Entitlement of Columbia Protestors,l216o0m,"I’m all for people protesting extreme militarism but let’s be honest the vast majority of these protestors have ulterior motives. For instance the one leader at Columbia who shallowly called for the revitalization of the final solution. Their solution to a supposed genocide is to of course call back to the politics of one of the most deadly genocides in world history. They openly promote Hamas and other Islamic radicals. Their mission is the destruction of the state of Israel. They’re not friendly people. They have a bad mission in mind. All that being said the use of excessive military action in Gaza by the IDF is worth calling out. It’s horrible, no one should be indifferent to the idea of a human population living in squalor and its children dying in unspeakable ways."
1ch8b2r,The Entitlement of Columbia Protestors,l223kwk,"Well said. These protesters are at best idiots with too much free time, at worst terrorist sympathizers advocating for the destruction of Israel - and anyone who believes that is on the same moral level as the terrorists who've run Gaza for the last 17 years.

The only peaceful resolution is a two-state solution, which Palestinians have shot down something like 5 times since 1948 when the British gave up control of the region and it was carved out by the UN.

It's unfortunate what's been going on in Gaza, but none of this would've happened had October 7th not happened. There could've been peace, but unfortunately the terrorists chose war, and now the people are unfortunately paying the price.

Nothing Columbia University protesters do will make any difference, and if anything detracts from the cause of peace. The only side who'd benefit from a ceasefire is Hamas - who'd use the pause to regroup and attempt to commit another October 7th, which they've vowed to do because their terrorist animals.

How many of these protesters are protesting against Hamas?"

1ch8b2r,The Entitlement of Columbia Protestors,l21zf9b,"I completely agree with you on the end goal of the protesters. I just want to clarify the point though. 

Islam is not a beautiful religion. Their Jesus is not the Christian Jesus. The end goal of Islam is the submission of the world to Sharia law. Their method of war is giving their conquests the option of paying blood money and submitting or dying. Their definition of heaven is hedonism. Their god is contradictory as he determines these hedonistic behaviors as evil to a Muslim while physically alive, but promises everything that is forbidden and determined evil as heaven. Their prophet married a 9 year old girl (which is the maximum estimated age). The quran is a book to be recited and memorized, but not understood. From the Christian perspective, this religion is satanic and the greatest deception.

The Christian Jesus is God incarnate as a Jewish man, therefore ""from the seed of the woman,"" (not of a human) as it says in Genesis. He is like the body of a human, whereas the Holy Spirit is ruach, and the Father is the heart. Three in one; one God. He was the Law fulfilled when He died on the cross as the sacrificial lamb, in which God foretold through Abraham. Jesus, being infinite as God incarnate in His sinlessness, was the ultimate sacrifice where His blood satisfies God's perfect justice by covering our limited sin. The end goal of Jesus is God's glory being acknowledged and chosen by a majority who love Him, as it is in the kingdom of Heaven. The Christian definition of heaven is to be with God,  Yeshua, and to praise Him forever. The Christian God fulfills His covenant, from the ancient, and shows no contradiction. Jesus lived a perfectly sinless and impactful life; so much so, His ministry has changed the world towards the compassionate morality of God. His ressurection is the clear message that believing in Jesus is life; a relief from the damnation of death (separation from God) that was the result of Adam. The Bible is encouraged to be read and understood, as it will never be possible for a human to stop learning about God's good character from it. 

Pro-Palestinian protestors are either motivated by the Islamic end goal or victim to their ""moral"" (again, hypocritical) strategy of lying to gain support, as supported by their quran and hadiths. They also believe the only way to have a guarantee of heaven is  to by a martyr for Islam, which encourages extremism towards their end goal."

It's not uncommon in any anti state protest regardless of the topic nowadays, from Aus to UK to France to the US.


""They are looking for America to suffer for providing military equipment to the IDF, without thinking about what the larger picture may be in regards to supporting a war against terrorism.""



Wtf does this mean lol? They're looking to divest from Israeli military, that's all."
1ch8b2r,The Entitlement of Columbia Protestors,l21y3l4,"No one is surprised... These colleges have been including these types of people or thinking for a long time now. Let them protest it's fine. They can live in the quad and yell to their hearts content. I'm not offended, it's a good freedom to protest. I don't feel sorry for any poor Columbia studebts trying to study because that's an oxymoron, theres no poor Columbia student. They have more resources than most, they'll manage.

1cgzxhm,How can liberal people want to create a Palestinian state?,l1zj9od,"The success of Jews and Israel is such an indictment of their basic worldview (oppressed people can never succeed on their own and need intervention from the ""good"" people).

1cgzxhm,How can liberal people want to create a Palestinian state?,l1z6i2i,"Liberals want to create a Palestinian state in their image, not based on any reality of who currently leads the Palestinian people or what their goals are.

It's a blank slate - a tabula rasa.

So you'll hear things about how their Palestine would follow XYZ ideal and do this that and the other.

It's all just projection of what they want, not the reality of what the demands of the leadership is."
1cgzxhm,How can liberal people want to create a Palestinian state?,l1zdao4,"It's simple, the ""westerners"" supporting a Palestinian state don't understand they are supporting a religious war, they have done zero research on the subject and are easily manipulated by bad actors. They are focusing on this part ""Genocide of innocent people"". An educated westerner would not support the Free Palestine movement but instead support a solution that achieves peace now. It's kind of sad really, they mean well but are ultimately supporting the genocide of the Palestinian people."
1cgzxhm,How can liberal people want to create a Palestinian state?,l1znt86,I support a Palestinian state for philosophical reasons (they’ve been there for so long and that’s the only home many know) and for pragmatic ones too (the current set up is unsustainable and dangerous ) but I have absolutely zero illusions about what the reality would be. I expect that it would be authoritarian and conservative because it has always operated like that. I think a lot of far left people are projecting a utopia on Palestine that has never existed and I doubt will exist. That’s why I don’t feel comfortable throwing myself behind this movement. It has a very long history of consistently supporting the worst ideologies and some of the worst people. People will say social activism is not transactional but that’s a lie. Everything is transactional on some level and I don’t believe in becoming bosom buddies with movements that go against everything I believe in.
1cgzxhm,How can liberal people want to create a Palestinian state?,l209ww2,A Palestinian state existing alongside Israel would end the problem of people being born stateless while also guaranteeing Israel's right-to- exist. It's unfair for people to be born without being citizens of a country.

They also don't believe people are inherently evil or mean.  So that's off the table.

So they're left with a view of the Palestinian people that have a perfectly fine religion and they're all just nice people who want to get along.

Of course this isn't the reality of the situation, but for whatever reason they just don't allow their thoughts to even broach the idea that people could really be evil, or a religion could be indoctrinating children with bad ideas.  (Unless it's Israel, because Tik Tok).

The reality of the situation is just too much for some people to handle, so they don't.  They stop before things get complicated and hope that simplistic solutions will work."

You should be using the word leftist when you ask this question. 

Leftist desire a state of Palestine because they care more about opposing western expansion and imperialism and less about propagating liberal values. 

Some liberals fall into the trap of the paradox of tolerance. They believed in tolerance so much that they end up supporting forces that would destroy them.

But most liberals support Israel because they provide a beach head for the expansion of liberal values into one of the few aliberal powers left in the world. They may not word it so...coldly but this is the general sentiment."

I know people firmly in this camp.  Most of them are the type of who’ve blindly accepted a patchwork of fashionable political stances, some of which are contradictory.  They never learned to think critically, or to test their ideas against reality.  

Social media also plays a role, as does the typical liberal preference for mercy over justice.

It is certainly a nonsense position to hold, though.  

Break it down to something more simple, what does a “free” Palestine look like?  Without access to Israel’s economy and infrastructure.  What is life like for the women and children?  To say nothing of LGBT, people with disabilities, non-Muslims, etc.

So there is no need for a political union between Belgium and the Netherlands if people can travel, work, and trade freely, and the only limit is where people can live permanently and vote.

Unfortunately I think the 2nd Intifada and this Hamas war may have killed the idea of economic union. Even if two-states were to move forward again, I suspect the economic ties are going to be thin and more top-down projects, like Jordan-Israel."

""Other clips show soldiers inside a mosque reciting a Jewish prayer down a microphone. The Palestinian foreign ministry condemned what it called ""a mockery of [the mosque's] sanctity"".

In a statement on Thursday, the IDF said the soldiers ""acted against IDF codes of conduct within a religious establishment"".

The statement said those responsible ""were immediately removed from operational activity"".

It added: ""The behaviour of the soldiers in the videos is serious and stands in complete opposition to the values ​​of the IDF.""

The incidents in Jenin are not the first time Israeli soldiers have been upbraided for bad behaviour filmed and posted on social media recently.

Since Israeli forces have been fighting the war in Gaza from the end of October, videos have emerged including showing a soldier smashing up a toy shop, while the person filming laughs; soldiers setting fire to goods in the back of a lorry; and another rummaging through women's clothes in what appears to be a private residence.

On Sunday, IDF spokesman Rear Adm Daniel Hagari condemned the soldiers' behaviour.

""IDF forces operate according to the values and spirit of the IDF,"" he said. ""Soldiers on the battlefield are required to act professionally and ethically, and we will not compromise on this. In any event... [the videos do not] align with IDF values, command and disciplinary steps will be taken - this is the way in the IDF."" ""

The Israeli notion that the Arabs drove Jews from Palestine is absurd, when Palestine was most likely predominately Christian by the time the time Muslims conquered it..

I wonder if there are Palestinian homes with similar artifacts and I wonder what the background to why they have them. why does your family keep them?

In the past, before the late 1980 up to 30% of the Palestiniabn workforce worked in Israel.  From the early 1990s to mid-2000s about 10% worked in Israel.

So the implication would be that the population was mostly Jewish at the time the rabbi lived so they worshipped him, then later the population converted but continued worshipping the same person.

I've seen far better answers and defense of what the IDF is doing from this subreddit. I don't understand how an Israeli spokesperson can be worse than a reddit shitposter. 

Overall this interview a very bad look for Israel, and I'm saying this as someone who is pro-Israel. However I did like how he mentioned that people are asking for an unreasonable burden of proof yet take anything from Hamas at face value."
1ch2rmr,"Thoughts on the interview with the Israeli Government Spokesman, David Mencer",l20vkdh,"I think both the Israeli spokesperson and the interviewer had their moments and rhetorical stumbles.

Point for the interviewer: the question about when the IDF presented a model for a 3 story command center under the Shifa hospital, justifying the assault.  What evidence was there for the existence of this command center? Even when pressed about the existence of this command center, the Israeli spokesperson never addresses it, only referring to the existence of tunnels over and over again. Tunnels aren't a command center.

Point for the spokesperson: the interviewer essentially accuses Israel of breaking international law, the example being a UN security council resolution to find a ceasefire. Except the Israeli spokesperson points out the resolution was specifically non-binding. Not a good look to accuse Israel of breaking international law, but your only example isn't international law."

1cgxqok,The eternal war ?,l1ysm6w,"First, Israel never said the goal is ""surrender of Hamas"".

Say what you will about Netanyahu, but he repeated the goals of the operation so many times it's unbelievable people are still confused about them.

There are 3 goals:

   * Return hostages
   * Remove Hamas from power in Gaza
   * Make it possible to safely live next to Gaza again

Second, it's highly unlikely Netanyahu will have to go to prison. The judges on his case all but ruled out most serious of allegations (bribery), the rest don't look serious enough for a real jail time, not to mention it might still take forever to get him convicted, and it doesn't matter all that much whether he is PM or not.

Third, the Government is in difficult position having to navigate between necessity to destroy Hamas, public demands to get hostages released by any means, and pressure from Biden administration. I am not saying they do everything perfectly, but perhaps let's cut them some slack? They are in very, very difficult position after the massacre, and what was archived so far isn't bad.

Fourth, it's true that Netanyahu avoids talking about post-war Gaza due to irreconcilable political differences in his cabinet between religious zionists and more moderate faction, and keeping his coalition is critical for his political survival. You can, of course, blame him for even thinking about politics instead of concentrating on national security, but he clearly made a decision to try to hold his coalition for as long as possible.

By comparison, the potential revenues from Gaza Marine (32 billion cubic meters) are extremely minimal. If Gaza Marine were to be seized by Israel, its development would have no significant impact on the country’s energy independence or its export plans.

2. in June 2023 Israel finally approved a plan for BP together with the PA and Egypt signed a deal to start developing it. it's incredibly silly to think Israel went through that negotiation process after years of objections simply to bomb Gaza to try and take it by force 4 months later

I also think there are ulterior motives to this war than the elimination of Hamas but again they don't need this war to specifically steal gas. I'm not sure if I've heard people say this war is because Israel wants to steal offshore gas it already has access to though, I've seen it highlighted as another negative aspect of Israeli policies.

They don't really think that they are going to end the Arab-Israeli conflict by occupying Hamilton Hall or taking over half the quad.  Nor do the protesters think that they will be able to micromanage the university's investments of its endowment by periodically invading buildings and refusing to leave. 

None of this is about ""protest"".  The ""protest"" itself is the goal.

What characterizes these ""protests""?  Violent rhetoric, or at least *intimidating* rhetoric, even if it straddles the line between outright calls to violence and implied calls for violence.  They're calling for ""*an* intifada"", not a repeat of the actually-very-violent ""Second Intifada"".  Coupled to the extreme rhetoric is the use of violence: forming human chains to expel ""Zionists"" from their claimed public space, a micro-battery but still an act of violence.  Same with the occupation of buildings and destruction of property.

Why are they doing all of this?  To ""call attention to their cause""?  Absolutely not.  The end goal of the protesters is to eliminate dissent on campus so that only their views are allowed to be expressed, and they are doing that by *forcing Jewish students to leave campus*.  Jewish students (in general) are likely to speak up in opposition to the calls for the elimination of Israel.  So to remove those students from campus, the ""protesters"" adopt the time-honored techniques of social shunning, extreme rhetoric, masked faces and ""anonymous"" chants - anything to create a hostile atmosphere so that the Jewish students on campus don't feel welcome there.  Other anti-Semites have used similar ""soft"" terrorism against Jews in the past to force them to leave communities, and it is being done right now on American college campuses with exactly the same goals.  

Coincidentally, the administration on many of these campuses has *exactly the same goal*: to end the dissent, because they do not like the optics of a divided student body.  How is the administration effecting this?  The same way the protesters are - by encouraging Jews to transfer out.  The administration does this by supporting the protesters in their cause of creating a hostile environment, and nowhere is that more clear than at Columbia University, for example.  At Columbia, the administration makes endless empty threats of ""possible enforcement of rules"" and ""potential expulsion unless we decide to give you amnesty two days later"".  Even today, the administration hilariously declared that protesters forcibly occupying Hamilton Hall ""face expulsion""; that is, maybe they will be expelled?  But probably not (wink. wink.).

1cgqi9z,Thoughts on Zionism vs Kahanism?,l1xknho,"Fuck the Kahanists, they are a disgrace to Judaism and have basically the Palestinian attitude in reverse. They want all the land and feel entitled to it by way of their own superiority. Their popularity represents the failure of the Israeli population to see past its own pain."

1cgqi9z,Thoughts on Zionism vs Kahanism?,l1xmrqb,"I have marched and will march again until my last day against Kahanists. They are the biggest threat to zionism, the state of Israel, and Jews as a whole."
1cgqi9z,Thoughts on Zionism vs Kahanism?,l1xi913,"This is really interesting to me. I feel like a lot of the unnecessary antagonism between the two sides comes from either 1) rhetoric on the part of pro-Palestinians that casually insists that Israel should just cease to exist, or 2) the assumption often made on the part of pro-Israel parties that all activism on behalf of Palestine and against Israel is also necessarily claiming that Israel should cease to exist. In other words, it seems like a lot of the rancor hinges on whether or not Israel should exist in the first place. 

To my mind, that disagreement is dumb— Israel does exist, people live there, and it’s also a nuclear state, so it’s not going anywhere. And also, it’s hard to have a conversation about peace when the party in charge feels like their existence is being threatened. Even Hamas has accepted Israel’s de facto right to exist.

I wouldn’t call myself an anti-Zionist, but my sympathy lies with Palestinians in the sense that I think a lot of what has happened to them since the 1930s has been brutal, violent, and unjust. Also, as a U.S. citizen I object to US funding of Israeli apartheid, and finally, censorship surrounding this particular position in the United States is intolerable to me. I know that I probably see that history differently from most people on this sub, so try to engage in good faith. The truth is I don’t really have a strong opinion on the core of Zionism itself. The ideology had a lot of problems; it was a 19th century settler philosophy… of course it had problems, they all did. But I do understand why Jewish people felt they needed a state, after centuries of persecution for being a stateless people, and why, in the aftermath of the holocaust/expulsions throughout the Middle East, Jewish refugees set out to make that happen with the endorsement and facilitation of western powers. More importantly, Israel exists now, it’s home for a lot of people, and those people aren’t going anywhere. 

Interestingly, when I press a lot of my anti Zionist friends, none of them genuinely believe Israel should just stop existing. At the same time, the majority of the more ridiculous, vituperative things I’ve heard from my pro-Israel friends seem to stem from this fear that they have, that everyone who is anti-Zionist wants to threaten Israel’s right to exist. I guess this is fair, since Zionism means different things to different people, and they’re watching their peers call themselves anti Zionists. And a lot of the protests I’ve been to have chants like “we don’t want no two-state, we want all of ‘48.” So obviously some people genuinely want israel to dissolve. But I genuinely don’t know anyone over the age of 26 or so who actually feels that way, and I traffic in pretty far left circles. 

I guess my point is that I feel like the vast majority of pro-Palestine people who genuinely want peace (including my friends who have been going to ceasefire protests) would get down with this, but they’re so caught up on the word Zionism. To a lot of them, Zionism seems like the extension of that 19th century philosophy into present-day Likud irredentism and challenges to Palestinian sovereignty, like settlements/apartheid in the West Bank, and the blockade on Gaza. And to some, the Zionism they rally against is basically just kahanism. Of course I know that this is not how many of my zionist friends would define it. But maybe if the pro- Palestinian left could give up their obsession with combatting “Zionism” (always writ large and without a clear definition) we could come closer to a solution that doesn’t alienate the Zionists who do want justice for Palestinians, and move beyond these damn culture wars. I (not Jewish, firmly pro-Palestine) would be willing to be a Zionist For Peace if it actually brought us closer to the aims you mentioned here."
1cgqi9z,Thoughts on Zionism vs Kahanism?,l21s9cx,"As for the page itself, it seems like an archetype for all the pseudo-liberal B.S I particularly hate seeing on the Israeli foreign ministry's various social media accounts, if this account/movement/organization whatever was ran by Israelis it would be more interesting as I am quite desperate to see organizations even if they peddle unoriginal Zionist talking points online exist in Israel that are at least genuinely interested in having a good-faith 2ss, but this doesn't seem to be ran by Israelis so it's just a lot less interesting to me. 

As for the definitions obviously both of the original definitions have undergone significant perversions as a result of the biases of the people (or person) behind the account seeping in. For one Kahanism is a religious extremist branch of Zionism, the definition they gave to Kahanism can also be applied to a plethora of other Zionists even non-religious ones, and the definition of Zionism itself is simply incorrect."

1cgya87,An outline of the IDF administration and settlement in West Bank,l1zr7gt,"Almost *all* of that is wrong

IDF doesn't ""administer"" territories, Areas A/B are administered by PA with Israel's security control.

Israel doesn't ""confiscate"" lands, and whatever disputes exist regarding land ownership in WB, they have nothing to do with ""rebels""

With an exception of several tiny villages in Area C who reportedly had to temporarily leave their homes due to clashes with settlers, Israel didn't ""evict"" anyone after 1967.

Refugee camps and refugees are for 1948 refugees. By now, they aren't much different than surrounding Palestinian villages.

Nobody is forced to work in Israel. In fact, a lot more Palestinians *want* to work in Israel than Israel allows for security reasons.

Administrative detentions are still approved by a judge. Israelis are also subject to detention if they are considered a security threat.

Palestinians have their own laws, police, courts and judges. They are only subject to Israeli military justice if this is related to terrorism or is against Israelis.

Etc."
1cgya87,An outline of the IDF administration and settlement in West Bank,l2185ow,">

I""ll try to keep it short.

1967 - Israel wins the territories of Judea and Samaria (or by its Jordanian name - the west bank of the Jordan river) from Jordan.

Later in 1987 Israel considers giving the territory back to Jordan due to high amounts of terror from the area and in return Jordan will take care of the terror problems, Jordan agrees to the offer but at the end due to inner politics Israel decides to cancel the offer. A year later Jordan decides to cut its ties with the territory as a whole.

1993-1998, Israel signs the Oslo accords with the Palestinians living in those territories. The Palestinian government gets full control of area A, the Israelis get full control over area C and Palestinians get civil control (laws, permissions, government decisions, etc...) over area B while the Israelis get the security control (a.k.a the protective army of the area is Israeli).

So by those agreements Israel is allowed to do whatever it wants with area C (by do whatever they want I mean they have full control over the area) including building settlements for Israelis.

However do note that the same laws inside of Israel apply there.

So if a someone builds an illegal house without permission, Israel is allowed to destroy it (and in my opinion they are pretty fair with this considering they do ruin settlements of both sides while also for some reason allowing certain illegal settlements to stay, with the most classic example being Khan al Ahmar).

However, if someone got the right permissions, Israel will not do anything to their home.

>2. **The fate of Palestinian evicted by their land**  
3. **IDF control over the movements of Palestinians and Israeli military Justice**

I""ll try to keep this one short as well although again - it's a complicated subject. I also think both are similar enough to receive one answer.

There are 3 groups of Palestinians, Gaza's Palestinians, Israel's Palestinians and Judea & Samaria's Palestinians.

Let's start with the easiest group of Israeli Palestinians, those live as normal citizens in Israel and get the same rights as Jews. So not much to add here.

2nd easiest is Gaza. Israel freed Gaza completely in 2005 after winning the territory from Egypt in 1967 (Same war Israel won Judea & Samaria from Jordan and like Jordan, Egypt also cut its ties with the territory) which means Israel no longer involves with whatever happens inside of Gaza. There was a temporary blockade that was put there by both Israel and Egypt in order to supervise the territory until everything is settled. The Gazans elected Hamas - a known terror organization that threatened both Israel and Egypt which forced both Israel & Egypt to put a permanent blockade on them - this blockade is worse than the original one in order to prevent Hamas from buying weapons. People there live in poverty not only because of the blockade that was put because of Hamas, but also because Hamas steals resources from their people and use all of their money to both live luxurious life style (Hamas leaders live in Qatar and are super rich) and in order to buy weapons to attack Israel with. Israel actually allowed Gazans to work inside of Israel in order to help the Gazans with those problems but after they use that opportunity to collect information that used in Hamas attack of the 7th of October, I doubt it will stay an option...

Last group is the Palestinians of Judea & Samaria. Like we said earlier, area A is completely Palestinian, so security issues only relate to areas B+C.  Checkpoints were only added after the second Intifada which was a massive terror attack of Palestinians against Israel after Israel attempted to sign peace agreements with them (Both the Oslo accords from earlier and the camp David summit). That was the Palestinians way to say they reject any peace deal with Israel.

Israel however doesn't deny them of work, food, hospitals, etc... Just like any other territory in a country - respect the laws and you'd be allowed to do whatever you want...

Also, due to many terror attempts it's true Israel is allowed to lock criminals without a trial but if they want the arrest to last longer than 48 hours, then a sign of the minister of defense is required. The one being arrested is allowed to appeal to the Israeli supreme court of justice. Btw this system is not an Israeli invention. Many countries also have this method however for obvious reasons (no war, no terror wave = no real need to use a tool useful for dealing with many criminals) they don't use it as much."
1cgya87,An outline of the IDF administration and settlement in West Bank,l1z624r,"Israel's legal defense, which has not been overcome, is that it's settlements are not illegal because the west bank is disputed territory. Them having been accused over and over of doing something illegal does not equate to them actually having done something illegal. 

Israel occupied the West Bank as a result of the 6 day war. Reminder, that was the war where Egypt, Jordan, and Syria joined forces to attack Israel and lost in 6 days. The West Bank was previously annexed by jordan, but this annexation was not recognized by anyone. In other words, the previous “owners” of the land also owned it illegally. Therefore, there is no “other party” as it pertains to international occupation laws. 

This is the basis of how the settlements have come to be. Israel annexes land in the disputed territory, because you can do that legally in an occupation, for your military. It moves it’s settlers in simultaneously with the military, and it becomes a self completing mechanism. It’s also of note that international occupation laws aren’t really designed to deal with long term occupations. 

What needs to be understood is that Israel is taking this approach in the WB for a reason. Settlers move in, and Israeli soldiers are then allowed to protect them. The settlers themselves prevent the area from becoming as hegemonic as Gaza, and the presence of the soldiers there further prevents the situation from escalating as far as Gaza has. There is a tactical strategy for its settlements existence there, and it is only possible because of the six day war. 

You really don't have to like the approach. It's okay to be mad about it. But they aren't actually doing anything illegal, and the outcomes of the WB have obviously been a lot better than Gaza, if you are to compare the difference in strategies taken. In terms of movement between Gaza and WB, you obviously have to traverse Israel to do so, and Israel has a vested interest in having some level of control over their borders, especially given that there is a large terrorist presence on the other side of all of their borders.

Jordan, Egypt, and Lebanon do not allow Palestinians to migrate or seek asylum. Israel has a good reason to not let them into Israel. This is where you hear the term ""open air prison"" come from, because nobody is actually willing to take the people who would like to leave. Again, there is reason why each country does not take them. They have before, and it's resulted in terrorism and attempted coups every time. So they don't. And that's why they are stuck there."

It's complicated and with respect, your post and potentially your view point is over simplifying the situation. 

First off, some history: 

* A lost of Arabs (who now call themselves Palestininians) were kicked out of their homes in 1947-48 mostly during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. Some left pseudo-voluntarily because they wanted to get away from the fighting because the Arab countries had warned that they would essentially be carpet bombing Israel, and some were evacuated or removed by the Haganah after the outbreak of the war; all of these folks thought they'd be returning.
* It's worth noting that in any area that ended up Arab-controlled in the 1948 War, 100% of the Jewish population was expelled but because the Arab forces failed to capture very many areas that had significant Jewish populations, so this was a much smaller number.
* Neither side allowed any of these refugees to return to their homes after the war, but there were a lot more Arab/Palestinian refugees.
* Most of the Jewish refugees were from East Jerusalem and the Old City, which ended up in Jordanian hands; the Jordanians gave the now-empty Jewish homes to Arab families (many of them refugees from what is now Israel).
* Israel passed laws requiring property owners with Ottoman and British-era titles to retain the titles on condition that they be resident in Israel. That meant that any Arab family who had fled outside of Israel that had no members remaining inside of Israel, lost their titles to their homes in Israel.
* That meant a *lot* of Arab/Palestinian properties had their titles taken over by Israel in the 1950s. The Israeli government was dealing with massive immigration at that time as hundreds of thousands of Jews fled or were expelled from Arab countries, and came to Israel without property or sufficient housing. As a result, the titles for these properties ended up being given to Jews (or being knocked down in favor of high density housing, for Jews).
* In 1967, Israel fought another war against all of its Arab neighbors. As a result, it ended up occupying East Jerusalem, the Golan Heights, Gaza, the West Bank, and most of the Sinai desert.
   * Israel returned the Sinai to Egypt in 1978 in exchange for peace; by this point, Egypt wouldn't accept Gaza back. Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005.
   * Israel continued to occupy the West Bank since Jordan wouldn't accept it back similarly to Egypt and Gaza. Some Israelis want to annex the West Bank, but most want to turn (some or all of) it over to Palestine in exchange for peace (as part of a ""two state solution""); this hasn't happened yet. The major population centers and the 'connective tissue' between them (areas A and B of the WB) are controlled by the Palestinian Authority; Israel controls Area C, the sparsely populated hinterland that makes up a very small portion of the population, but a very large portion of the land.
   * Israel annexed East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights in the 1980s; Israel considers these permanent parts of Israel."
1cgya87,An outline of the IDF administration and settlement in West Bank,l1zpl57,"These are all basically accurate. 

Part of the context is that hundreds of violent terrorist attacks have been launched by Palestinian in revenge for settler attacks & land seizure, and the security apparatus is mostly built to protect Jewish settlers, and Israelis in general."
1cgya87,An outline of the IDF administration and settlement in West Bank,l1z28ln,"As to 1): the confiscated land is not Israeli state land, but Palestinian ""state"" land. Israel as the occupying power only administers it which is an important difference. 

As to 3): Of course the Palestinians in the occupied territories are subject to military justice. Subjecting them to Israeli civilian justice would be illegal, as the territories are not under Israeli soveriegnty (Israel is only excreting Palestinian sovereignty for them as occupying power). In fact, it is very much a questionable practice to *not* extend military justice to civilian West Bank settlers (who have no business being there in the first place, even if the land they reside in is their civil property under applicable aw in the territories)."
1cgya87,An outline of the IDF administration and settlement in West Bank,l1z9ll7,"These are the points Pro-Palestine people don't understand in the slightest.  And part of that is due to efficient PR by Hamas following their 10/7 atrocities.  Until now, very few in the West cared.  Then 10/7 happened and suddenly the rise of Palestine support is noted.  The sad part: these university protests, resolution meetings in a few city halls, public protests and demonstrations at Jewish districts and businesses, boycotts, etc., aren't helping Gaza.  Ramah is going to likely be invaded for the elimination of Hamas leaders (especially Sinwar).  Those civilians didn't ask for this war and yet many in the West call for the same thing Hamas does.  All it has done is embolden Hamas to resume using their own Gazan citizens for fodder against IDF artillery.

Hamas has legitimately turned Gaza into a terror tunnel city.  And those fighting against Hamas (like Bassam Eid and Mosab Yousef) on a advocacy side of things have experienced this or seen many parts that the Pro-Palestine supporters cry as ""Zionist lies"".  There may also be individuals with Hamas within the WB that may target Israeli citizens more now that most IDF operations are focused on Gaza itself."

So what's happening now?

* In **East Jerusalem,** there are a bunch of Arab families who are living in homes owned by Jewish families (either because those families were their landlords in the 1940s, or because the Jordanians moved them into these houses between 1948-1967). For exampel, in Sheikh Jarrah, what you're seeing are essentially super-polarizing-and-highly-publicized landlord-tenant disputes; Palestinians are indeed being kicked out of their homes but not because of any malevolence or vigilante motivation, but because their landlords are trying to evict them.
* In **Palestinian towns in the West Bank**, Israel has maintained a policy of 'punitive demolition', in which the homes of the perpetrators of terrorist attacks are bulldozed as an attempt at a disincentive against political violence; no one is 'confiscating' those homes or that land, but it is an example of collective punishment.
* In **settlements** in Area C of the West Bank, Israelis are being permitted by the state to build houses on 'Palestinian' land. As a rule though that's **not** land that any Palestinian family lives on or has a title, but it's often land that's historically had some kind of public use for Palestinians generally (e.g., grazing land) and it's always land that is theoretically **nationally** Palestinian (that is, intended to become part of the state of Palestine).
   * Usually when you hear about Israeli settlement expansion, this is explicitly permitted by the Israeli government, but also isn't taking up **new** land; it's a permit to build on land that's already within one of the existing, usually large and well established, settlements.
   * However, Israel does implicitly allow new settlements to be built by often failing to police their own rules effectively. Israel does demolish hundreds of these a year, but many folks feel like they do not do this enough.
* Finally, in **uninhabited land** in Area C of the West Bank which is 100% administered by Israel, Israel does commonly demolish Palestinian settlements. Generally these are reported on as 'villages', but these are essentially **new** communities (or people returning to rebuild communities that were destroyed 50 years ago, etc). This isn't so Jews can move in but is because they are in violation of Israeli law which requires building permits from the Israeli Government to build or set up buildings which applies to all across Israel, and 100% of Area C as per the Oslo Accords.

1cg6q49,This is more plausible than genocide:,l1tqhay,"Ex British Army Officer here.

Among the military community there is no doubt that the IDF goes well beyond the ""international standards"" when it comes to preventing civilian casualties.

You'd expect a combatant to civilian kill ratio of 1:8 or worse in an arena like Gaza. Instead we're seeing something closer to 1:1.5.

During my training we looked at the 2014 war in Gaza as an example of preventing civilian casualties in such a complex arena. 

There are currently 18 wars that are both ongoing, and larger than the Israeli Palestinian conflict when it comes to total deaths, and also the civilian combatant death ratio. Almost none of these conflicts are accused of having a genocide, and none of them seem to be getting the international condemnation that Israel is getting."
1cg6q49,This is more plausible than genocide:,l1up2p4,"Do not attribute to genocide what can be attributed to lots of other things.

If you want to believe it's genocide, then you have to at least admit that you only believe it because of speculation of motive. You can even back up your speculation with evidence (i.e. bombing hospitals), but there are other reasons that hospitals may have been bombed, so while you may feel it supports the argument, it remains speculative. There's otherwise no concrete evidence, which I would argue could basically only exist in explicit directives by legitimate Israeli sources that their intent is in to literally genocide Palestinians.

It's entirely possible and likely that Israel just wants to lock down Gaza to avoid further attacks like Oct 7, and they're willing to do that at tremendous cost of Palestinian life. In fact, I think this is the more likely truth. They could commit a thousand warcrimes in Gaza and it may still not be explicitly genocide.

This obviously isn't a good thing, but genocide by International Law standards requires a very special type of intent called dolus especialis, which even the ICC hasn't granted (though the case is ongoing). The ICC's admission of 'plausibility' had nothing to do with genocide being plausible. Here's a quote:

>the International Court of Justice (ICJ) found that ‘at least some of the rights claimed by South Africa and for which it is seeking protection are plausible’, including ‘the right of the Palestinians in Gaza to be protected from acts of genocide and related prohibited acts’

Article here: [https://opiniojuris.org/2024/04/05/the-icjs-findings-on-plausible-genocide-in-gaza-and-its-implications-for-the-international-criminal-court/](https://opiniojuris.org/2024/04/05/the-icjs-findings-on-plausible-genocide-in-gaza-and-its-implications-for-the-international-criminal-court/)

This means that the ICJ found it plausible that Gazans can be protected from acts of genocide, it has nothing to do with the actual act of genocide being plausible.

So, you can claim it's genocide if you feel that way, but it's a purely subjective and potentially emotional claim and it's not based on any ""mission statement"". It's speculative , but there are no standards by which any modern international law this would be considered genocide.

In short, you could drop 20 nukes in Gaza and bury every dead Palestinian in the most inhumane way, and it would be horrible, but it may still not be reasonably defined as genocide.

Conversely, various Jihadist groups (Hamas included) explicitly call for the death of jews. The attack on October 7th is easier to prove as a genocide than anything Israel has done during this conflict."
1cg6q49,This is more plausible than genocide:,l1ypxqc,"I agree.  I’m appalled by Israel’s actions in this war, but that doesn’t make it a genocide.  Both sides are war criming each other on a weekly basis."

It’s more likely that their goal is to butcher Hamas and that they don’t care how they get there (including keeping any reservists or soldiers who may be actually genocidal).

Israel does ALOT in order to respect the international law, but it's kind of impossible not to hit innocents when terrorists hide within the population.

So far I didn't see a single person who actually provided a solution for what Israel can do to get rid of Hamas & return the hostages with less damage.

So far what Israel does is:

* Israel provides resources to Gaza (water, electricity, oil)
* Israel allows humanitarian aid to enter Gaza
* Israel asked the population to evacuate to Raffah on day one while attacking the rest of Gaza
* Israel takes the war slowly instead of just blowing up the whole place in 2 days like they did in the war of 1967.
* Israel agreed to pretty much any ceasefire deal that didn't asked them to finish the war completely.

So it's not like Israel didn't do whatever it could to protect the population, but at the same time this is a war and when terrorists hide within the population, international law itself claims that a country should attack even if they hit human shields..."
1cg6q49,This is more plausible than genocide:,l1uevx4,">I think it’s far more plausible that Israel is disregarding international law standards than actively trying to commit a genocide.

I would not necessary say completely disregarding, doing that would mean a lot more Palis dead eg Russia not giving a damn if they use hilariously inaccurate missiles with a CEP of 5km, blowing up entire occupied dedicated maternity hospital with 2,000+ people because a single Ukrainian soldier may have temporarily been in there to visit his wife, or just straight up leveling the entire city with artillery.

But some of the airstrikes, particularly in the month or two right after October 7th where emotions were high, had extremely loose interpretations which, while technically not illegal, were really against the spirit of the law (2,000 pound bombs dropped in Jabaila was not a great tradeoff or good PR to get one Hamas commander and some militants). And probably more could have been done to facilitate aid or more (realistic) thought given to what would happen once Hamas was pushed from north/central Gaza since they should have known Egypt/Jordan would probably draw a hard line at accepting any refugees short of credible threats to nuke Cairo or Amman. No one in the region wants more Palis in their country."

1cg45xc,The people behind the protests,l1to1ku,"Who is Hamas?

This is a relevant question. The entire insurgency, and the surrounding propaganda only really works because nobody outside of Palestinians living in the area even really knows who is and isn't cooperating or participating in the organization. ""Aid"" can be sent to organizations that don't have to openly disclose that they're working with Hamas, because you can just say that these particular people aren't in Hamas. In practice, we see all of the money and aid getting ""looted"" by someone and the people of Gaza are still starving to death, despite more food being sent there than any other place on Earth. The brainwashed can look at this, and because the reporting doesn't say ""hamas is stealing the aid"", assume that it's not Hamas doing it. Those people wouldn't believe that it's hamas doing it unless Hamas themselves reported that they're doing it. It's insane. Like who else in Gaza can forcefully loot/take control of the aid packages and then sell it back to people? Come on.

The propaganda is also mixed messaging at this point, if you ask me. These people being all the way down the hole to ""we are all hamas"" does not make sense. Hamas cannot both be an oppressive minority force in palestine who is \*really\* causing all of the trouble, and a group of freedom fighters that ""we are all"" a part of. Which one is it?

I think the biggest question that isn't being asked enough is: ""Why aren't the Palestinians giving up Hamas?""

If they're really that oppressive minority force causing the palestinians so much trouble, you'd think that this would be a perfect opportunity for the Palestinians to turn them over to the people with bigger guns. They aren't out in the streets with signs saying ""hey, they are under this building, please come get them instead of bombing us"". Ask yourself the question, and ponder it honestly. If you were living in an area being bombed because the cartel/gang in charge of your city is doing terrorism that you didn't agree with, what would you do? Sit there and continue to let them hide in your apartment building, or would you go tell someone who could help you? IMO, enough time has passed. There really isn't a difference in ""palestine"" and hamas. It's one in the same.
