sqd1ov,Why not,hwr19fj,I think that would go under the list of ways to start WW3.
sqd1ov,Why not,hxjrfya,"Pretty ironic that Americs is claiming the attacks are all false flags by Russia, even when Ukraine are saying there's a low chance of war.
 
 It's time the U.S just stayed the fuck out of other countries shit. Let em at it!
 
 And Australia's prime minister getting all stroppy with Russia. Like Russia gives a fuck what Australia thinks. 
 
 There's a lot of politics being played, with other country's borders. It's pathetic."
sqd1ov,Why not,hy85xh8,"Putin will now consolidate forces and secure those regions. Then he will see the world response and either wait them out or push for all Ukraine.
 
 The west is now all bark and no bite, especially when they face an equal power. Any conflict will be bloody and can reach the soil of North America. Europeans best be ready for crazy prices. It is easier to let them have it. No western country would have allowed a Warsaw pact country on its border. It would have been wise Ukraine went neutral. Then there would have been no invasion."
sqd1ov,Why not,iipce7q,"We donâ€™t need to involve ourselves in a war. Only reason we are threatened is because we help Ukraine, which I wholeheartedly support btw. But we should not go to all out war unless provoked to do so. Just like we stayed out of WW2 until attacked, I believe itâ€™s wise to do so now as well."
sqd1ov,Why not,hwpu4ev,Dam that would kick it off alright
sqd1ov,Why not,hx9464k,"Have you ever served? Unless you're willing to go out there and put your money where your mouth is, there's no winners in this situation. This is all political, just like every war since WW2."
sqd1ov,Why not,hxg2j52,I think Putin has a load of cash and is trying to get the market down so he can invest and he can get richer.
sqd1ov,Why not,hxg9rom,"I love the idea, but we value human life a lot higher than the Russian government does (at least currently, letâ€™s not get into the multiple false flag events the US has engaged in on national soil.)"
sqd1ov,Why not,hxn5dwc,"Why isn't anyone news or otherwise talking about Ukraine's missing 120,000 tons of Uranium that is supposedly unaccounted for? Maybe Putin wants it or doesn't want Nato to get it. It can be looked up on youtube ""ukraine missing uranium"" for those of you that think the news tells you everything and don't believe this posting."
sqd1ov,Why not,hxpwgwm,that is definintly starting a new war.
sq3sh8,What WOULD signal an attack? Cyber? An attack on the electrical grid? A pipeline?,hwjw9my,"I'd say electrical grid and a cyber attack to the major network providers to put ""everyone"" in the dark long enough for the ground troops to move in, but what do I know"
sq3sh8,What WOULD signal an attack? Cyber? An attack on the electrical grid? A pipeline?,hwl7an9,Sudden media blackout.
sq3sh8,What WOULD signal an attack? Cyber? An attack on the electrical grid? A pipeline?,hwmhuxn,My guess would be probably along the lines of starting of an uprising in Donbas region in eastern Ukraine and Russian forces moving into help the Russian speaking people
sq3sh8,What WOULD signal an attack? Cyber? An attack on the electrical grid? A pipeline?,hwxv3kt,"Has anyone heard any news from Russian troops actually stationed along the borders? I'm sure they would be aware if there was the potential to invade imminently, as they would have been told to be ""ready"" for the order. I can't imagine they haven't spoken to family etc and not mentioned this, and we are an international world now, cousins or whatever living in the west would hear from family and be told, and then let slip etc etc. Surely out of 130k troops someone would let slip and this info would leak? It'd be rumour yes, but these things have a habit of getting out... Anyone seen a story like that?"
sq3sh8,What WOULD signal an attack? Cyber? An attack on the electrical grid? A pipeline?,hxan5om,"Well, piling troops, equipment on a border, rally points for logistics, a long line of resources (fuel ammunition and support supplies) in a supply chain pipeline that is in place. It is going to be a Blitzkrieg type attack to grab as much land as possible and taking cover in urban neighborhoods for protection. Good luck Our Ukrainian Friends."
sq3sh8,What WOULD signal an attack? Cyber? An attack on the electrical grid? A pipeline?,hxb7y30,"USA is far from weak, they are looking for another war to fund the defense industry for another 20 years. The problem is that as tensions rise so does the cost of gas and oil which is my bitches main income. More tension and fighting the more he makes, so we need to stop buying Russian anything and boycott the Shit out of them."
sq3sh8,What WOULD signal an attack? Cyber? An attack on the electrical grid? A pipeline?,hxc00gt,"Here comes the False Flag Operation (out of the USA we need a reason to attack you Playbook) saying Ukraine attacked us 1st, it's only a matter of hours now. Run west civilians because Biden is just going to hand it off to the Generals and it is going to look like the 4th of July Fireworks when they start Raining Down Tomahawk Missiles on Russian forces . Time to Crank up THE IRON MAIDEN VIDEO... RUN TO HILLS"

sq3sh8,What WOULD signal an attack? Cyber? An attack on the electrical grid? A pipeline?,hxlrc5w,vladimir farts. its sweet...no invasion. its bad...invasion. wet fart...blitzkrieg.
sq3sh8,What WOULD signal an attack? Cyber? An attack on the electrical grid? A pipeline?,hxmvv8v,"Biden/liberals/globalist are using a super corrupt government that wants into nato and the global market and biden is telling them they have to pay to play and the dems will be making money and at the same time using the media propaganda machine to convince America that Russia is the bad guy and nobody will question that and they really hate Russia bc Russia doesn't fit the globalist agenda they are all nationalists and they will use the media to make everyone hate them bc they are guilty just like the ""Russian collusion"". Aside from that Russia doesn't want war with Ukrainian insurgent/guerrilla fighters attacking all the time they just want safe access to the black sea and the russian people who live in land the Ukraine government took"
spay54,"Oh, right, poison....we can poison people! Or divert airliners! WOOHOO!",hzumxbp,Hahahahahaha
spay54,"Oh, right, poison....we can poison people! Or divert airliners! WOOHOO!",hwh0qe9,I think the world is too afraid of WW3 to follow through on it's words and the line has been drawn in the sand. Ukraine is on the wrong side of that line unfortunately.
spay54,"Oh, right, poison....we can poison people! Or divert airliners! WOOHOO!",hxnk19j,"He doesnâ€™t want more demonstrations but Russian culture is different. They already see political competitors killed or arrested on a regular basis. A war might unite them behind Putin. If he invades we should have ICE round up all the wealthy children of oligarchs living in the US and tell them they can have Putin or their kids, but not both. There would be a lot of polonium making its way into the kitchen at the kremlin I bet"
spay54,"Oh, right, poison....we can poison people! Or divert airliners! WOOHOO!",hyq26mk,"It is NOT a war! The mainstream media and the fake news (CNN, NBC, Fox News, ABC, CBS...) have made it seem like a war, but it is really that the deep state in Ukraine have made it such a terrible country, so there were 2 county's that Asked to become part of Russia, (the mayors of those counties asked Putin) because it is safer than staying a part of Ukraine. Also, crime is higher in Ukraine than it is in Russia. and the Ukrain government has made it so, where the Government tells the people what to do, and they must do it. In Ukraine, the people have no free choice. The 2 counties joined Russia to free the people. The mainstream media and other left news stations have told the people that it is the beginning of a war, so they can speed chaos. Again, IT IS NOT A WAR!

spb1fb,"Ouch! Deaf, dumb, and unprepared soil....eek!",hxnj4sx,"I donâ€™t understand why the US doesnâ€™t just back channel to Putin that if he invades, he is putting his own life at risk? Why let one man kill 1000â€™s of people for no reason other than to stroke his ego? Everyone talks about if they had a time machine they would go back and kill hitler. Here is your chance! Take out Putin and that will bring all the other tyrants in line."

soja14,"What do we think, or: How should ""the West"" punish Putin, without punishing themselves (at least too much)?",hwa8gsp,"Putin may be an egomaniacal corrupt monster but keep in mind majority of Russians support Putin on this issue. Significant minority of Ukrainian population specially in eastern Ukraine also support putin. 
 
 Western media doesnâ€™t tell the Russian perspective at all. Ukraine was always part of Russia and was only carved as separate state as part of Soviet union after second world war by Stalin. So its not surprising Russians donâ€™t take it too well when Nato is expanding into Ukraine which they always considered a friendly backyard. Just imagine Chinese setting up military base in Canada and Mexico and what Americans reaction would be.

Everyone knows that technically it is impossible for a tank to target or strike a fighter jet, while on a fighter jet, you just need to pull the ASM triggerâ€¦â€¦. and poofâ€” no more tank.

Even being ran by a shadow government (NATO) there is 0 trust between the people and the government. This WAR will be the start of something very major!

Man kind is behind and wonâ€™t get far since they canâ€™t find ways to live and build without kill kill destroy destroy. Last I checked tho this is a Russian Ukraine War community. I was expecting more like updates. And this particular thread is literally saying Russian tanks have nothing against fighter jets when in reality if the tanks were made mainly to shoot down fighter jets the conversation would be different. But obviously both sides have â€œadvanced weaponsâ€ whether itâ€™s jets or tanks except Russia and China have numbers and their people (Russians canâ€™t speak for China) probably have a lot more trust and faith in their government. At the end both sides will fall so it doesnâ€™t matter much

sizyiw,"Why Russia probably won't attack Ukraine, let alone invade!",hy43vk0,"I am Russian, and I want to say that for the most part, the population of the country does not share the sentiments of the government. Most of the country's population considers Ukrainians to be a fraternal people and does not see any sense in this conflict at all. Putin said officially that Russia has no goal to expand its already huge territory, in a country in which it takes more than 10 hours to fly by plane from one end to the other end of the country, there is no point in conquering a new territory.
