1d354ix,"UA POV: Ukraine drone targets second Russian long-range military radar, Kyiv source says - Reuters",l64z5mv,"KYIV, May 27 (Reuters) - A Ukrainian drone targeted a long-range radar deep inside Russia on Sunday, the second such strike in a week on infrastructure used by Moscow to monitor Ukraine's military activities, a Kyiv intelligence source said.

The source said the strike was aimed at a ""Voronezh M"" radar near the city of Orsk in the Orenburg region some 1,500 km from the closest territory held by Kyiv's forces. The source, who declined to be named, did not say if there was any damage, but the move would make it one of the deepest attempted drone strikes in Russian territory since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

There was no immediate comment from Moscow on the matter, although Russia's Izvestia newspaper and other media outlets reported that a drone had come down in the Orenburg region on Sunday and that no civilian infrastructure had been hit.

The Kyiv source also confirmed reports of an earlier Ukrainian drone attack on a ""Voronezh-DM"" radar in southern Krasnodar region on May 22.

The Russian service of U.S. media outlet RFE/RL cited satellite imagery showing damage at the Voronezh-DM radar site in Krasnodar region. Reuters has not independently verified the imagery.

Thord Are Iversen, an independent defen—Åe analyst and former Norwegian Navy officer, said the radars were part of Russia's ballistic missile early warning system. Russia is a major nuclear power.

Their primary function, he told Reuters, was to detect and track intercontinental ballistic missiles and to determine if Russia was under nuclear attack. They also have secondary roles such as space tracking. Asked why the radars were targeted, the Kyiv source said: ""They monitor the actions of the Ukrainian security and defence forces in the south of Ukraine.""

With Russia's invasion now in its third year, Kyiv has increasingly relied on long-range drones to target Russian military and energy targets, in particular oil refineries, in recent months.

Russia has pounded Ukraine with long-range strikes throughout the war and renewed its aerial assault on the energy system, in what it says is retaliation for Kyiv's strikes on targets in Russia.

A Ukrainian media outlet cited an unnamed source saying the drone had flown 1,800 km (1,118 miles) in Sunday's attack.

Earlier this month Ukrainian intelligence source said that Kyiv's longest-range drone attack to date had targeted an oil processing plant in Russia's Bashkiria region at a range of 1,500 km."

Its hilarious because the message is ""Putin is a crazed dictator thatn threatens the world"" and on the same breath ""lets hit the nuclear radars stations deep inside his country, he wont do nothing""

Like...wtf, either he is dangerous or not, but if he is, how about dont poking him.  

And why these radar stations??? they have obviously ZERO relevance on the war on Ukraine, attacking them gives Ukraine absolutely nothing. They are about as irrelevant as it can be as a military target, so the obvious objective is either provocation, limit testing (to see what Russia would tolerate or where are the air defenses holes), or preparing to launch a nuclear attack on Russia. In either case...its fu\*\*ing insanity, absolute madness. This is the closests that we have been to actual nuclear warfare in history. I still dont think it will ever happen because is something that just destroys both sides and sends the world into the stone age, so everybody loses, but man, why are we doing this....

I hate it because this is obviously being done with the help and blessing of the US and the EU. Im sure the Pro-Ukraine crowd is high fiving and cheering, but man, i dont want to find out how Paris, Madrid, London, Rome and Berlin look after reconstruction, i like them the way they are."

>The source, who declined to be named, did not say if there was any damage

Because there wasn't any damage, if there was a hit to even begin with. So far all these claims of ""hitting"" those radars are coming from the Kiev regime. In fact damage to the first radar hit was superficial, and even the Russian MoD hasn't said anything about it."

1d354ix,"UA POV: Ukraine drone targets second Russian long-range military radar, Kyiv source says - Reuters",l656tf6,"The drones that attack deep inside Russia are only able to avoid radar detection with the help of the USA. Heads of state of NATO countries have hardly commented on these attacks on Russia's early warning system. Since these attacks directly affect US nuclear strategy, It's inconceviable that Ukraine would have done these multiple strikes without *at least* the consent of the USA.

Why would Biden want this? At the same time these attacks on Russia's early warning system occurred, NATO countries have been suggesting that their weapons be allowed be strike inside Russia. Russia has threatened to retaliate, potentially with tactical nuclear weapons.

Perhaps the the Biden administration is betting that the retaliation will not be nuclear if the amount of time that Russia has to determine whether or not Russia is under a nuclear attack (and should launch its own nukes) is significantly reduced from around 7 minutes (prior to these attacks) to only a few minutes. Of course, this also gives the USA a significant advantage in a first strike nuclear attack.

The USSR and NATO had 10‚Äôs of thousands of troops trained for these roles. But since the Cold War ended both sides thought it was pointless having these niche specialized brigades and so the disolved. The US might have like a battalion that is still trained for it just to keep up some of the skills, and Russia might have a couple of reserve units that they could muster to do it but it‚Äôs a lot of effort and work and then that still brings the crazy mess of using a nuke in the first place.

1d380b3,UA POV: Sweden announces $1.3 billion in military aid for Ukraine in largest package ever -Kyiv Independent ,l65hy4b,"If you're wondering what this package actually entails, the main parts are:

* 1 or 2 [ASC890](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saab_340_AEW%26C) Early Warning and Control aircraft
* Unknown number of [AIM-120](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIM-120_AMRAAM) A2A missiles
* Unknown number of [PBV 302](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pansarbandvagn_302) APCs (""the entire Swedish stock"")
* Unknown number of 155mm Artillery ammo
* ""Surplus tanks"" - Likely just an unknown amount of [Strv-122](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stridsvagn_122)s
* Satellite communications equipment
* Spare Parts, maintenance equipment, and ammunition for vehicles Sweden has/is donating
* Financial support

The extra tanks and APCs will help Ukraine replenish losses, although the actual number of each being donated is not public. Additionally, the PBV's will present Ukraine an additional challenge as it is an older APC not compatible with the other western equipment they have received so far. This means brand new training for operating and maintaining the vehicle, different parts that logistics needs to handle, and a limited supply of spare parts given how old the platform is (first built 1960s, retired fully 2014. Sweden had been cannibalising parts for the last years of their usage).

The ASC890 is a baffling choice to donate to Ukraine. Ukraine has not operated an EWC in a long time, and has no trained personnel. These aircraft use highly specialised equipment that needs specific training, which will take months to several years to complete. All of this to get 2 aircraft that fulfil the same role as other NATO aircraft currently do better, and from safety. Almost certainly being done as Sweden planned to get rid of these aircraft soon."

> 
> In particular, he sent a map of the Yavoriv training ground via Telegram to his supervisor from the 9th Directorate of the Operational Information Department of the 5th FSB Service, which showed the military camps of the International Peacekeeping and Security Centre. He also marked on the map the location of barracks and dormitories.
> 
> Kostorny did not repent of his actions and did not admit his guilt.
> 
> On 13 March 2022, the Russian military launched a cruise missile attack on the Yavoriv training ground. As a result, more than 60 people were killed and over 160 injured. Kostorny was detained in June of the same year during a special SBU operation, and was awaiting trial in custody.

Especially since it's gonna be a major priority target, the only thing that's going to get higher priority are gonna be SAM batteries, but those are not rawdogging the frontline like this thing will be. TOS rockets range from 2.5km to 6km to allegedly 10km for latest variants, but at that range they're probably so inaccurate that it isn't going to produce much effect. 

Just look at how pockmarked the fields in Ukraine are despite the fact that the trenches are almost always in the treelines (or the few hills). Even with tube artillery, it doesn't seem like Russian artillery is particularly accurate outside of the Krasnopols, which are not used on infantry usually."

1d2p8ns,RU POV: North Group strikes on entrenched UAF positions in Volchansk using thermobaric shells from heavy flamethrower systems.,l62haju,"Bro, you certainly showed you don't know what you're talking about. The spread of the hits is massively improved, and since it's thermobaric munition, it gets into every hole and crevice and kills with overpressure. The hits are concentrated on clusters of tall buildings, presumably used as a defence point by the Ukrainians. One barrage is all you need mostly, since the lethal range is over 100m. Additionally, not concentrating multiple weapon systems in the same spot is the name of the game in this war. Multiple barrages require multiple launchers in one spot, a very dangerous thing to do in the era of drones and precision guided shells. Besides that, the TOS-1A Solntsepyok has a really low range of 10km, and it's not the most mobile system ever. That was fixed by the TOS-2 Tosochka, which is a wheeled launcher with greater mobility and longer range, but we haven't seen an awful lot of those."

>   
> **Ein mutma√ülicher ukrainischer Drohnenangriff gegen eine Radaranlage des russischen Atom-Fr√ºhwarnsystems, das anfliegende interkontinentale Atomraketen erkennen soll, hat angeblich schweren Schaden angerichtet. Das birgt laut Milit√§rexperten Oberst Markus Reisner hochbrisanten Z√ºndstoff f√ºr eine neuerliche, gef√§hrliche Eskalation. Oberst Reisner beantwortet die drei Schl√ºsselfragen:**
> 
> - - - - - -
> 
> **1. Warum ist der mutma√üliche ukrainische Drohnenangriff auf die russische Radarstation Armawir im S√ºdwesten der Region Krasnodar √ºberaus bemerkenswert?**
> 
> Auf den vorgestern aufgetauchten Bildern ist zu erkennen, dass zumindest eines der beiden in Armawir stationierten russischen Voronezh-DM-Fr√ºhwarnradarsysteme bei einem gezielten Angriff schwer besch√§digt wurde. Russland verf√ºgt derzeit √ºber bis zu zehn derartige Fr√ºhwarnradarsysteme. Sie sind √ºber ganz Russland verteilt, auf Standorten in Murmansk, bei St. Petersburg, in Kaliningrad, in Barnaul, in Omsk, bei Irkutsk, bei Workuta, in Krasnogorsk und im genannten Armawir. Letztere aus zwei Radaren bestehende Anlage wurde gebaut, um √§hnliche, urspr√ºnglich in der Westukraine und auf der Krim installierte sowjetische Systeme zu kompensieren.
> 
> Bei diesen Voronezh-DM-Radaren handelt es sich um ‚ÄûOver-the-Horizon‚Äú (OTH) - ‚ÄûUltra High Frequency‚Äú (UHF)-Radare, welche Teil des russischen Fr√ºhwarnradarsystems zur Erkennung ballistischer Raketen sind. Die Radare haben eine Reichweite von horizontal 6.000 und vertikal 8.000 Kilometern. Ihr Ziel ist es, vor allem anfliegende amerikanische Atomraketen fr√ºh erkennen zu k√∂nnen, um rasch eigene Ma√ünahmen, darunter im √§u√üersten Fall einen russischen nuklearen Gegenschlag, einleiten zu k√∂nnen. Denkbar ist auch die Weitergabe von Fr√ºhwarndaten an Verb√ºndete, wie z.B. dem Iran, Nordkorea oder China.
> 
> **2. Welchen Nutzen h√§tte die Ukraine von solch einem Angriff auf russische Fr√ºhwarnradarsysteme?**
> 
> Die Ukraine verf√ºgt nur mehr √ºber Raketenwaffen mit begrenzter Reichweite. Eigene Systeme wie Tochka-U sind verbraucht und an vom Westen gelieferten Systemen sticht das von den USA stammende System Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) heraus. Dieses hat eine Reichweite von 300 Kilometern bei einer Flugbahnh√∂he von bis zu 60 Kilometern. Man k√∂nnte nun mutma√üen, dass die ukrainischen Streitkr√§fte Armawir ins Visier genommen haben k√∂nnten, weil sie bef√ºrchteten, dass der Standort dazu beitragen k√∂nnte, eine Vorwarnung f√ºr ihre Angriffe mit von den USA gelieferten ballistischen ATACMS zu geben. Armawir befindet sich jedoch knapp 700 Kilometer von m√∂glichen ATACMS Abschussr√§umen bei Cherson entfernt. D. h. aufgrund des Voronezh-DM-Radarhorizonts ist es bei dieser Reichweite schwierig, mit niedriger Scheitelbahnh√∂he fliegende ATACMS-Raketen zu detektieren. Die anvisierte einfliegende Rakete sollte sich zur exakten Messung zumindest in einer H√∂he von √ºber eintausend Kilometern befinden. Interkontinentalraketen fliegen in der Regel in H√∂hen von bis zu 2.000 Kilometern - also im optimalen Detektionsbereich des Voronezh-DM-Radars. F√ºr taktische Kurzstreckenraketen, wie ATACMS, sind andere Radarsysteme vorgesehen.
> 
> **3. Gibt es noch ein anderes Erkl√§rungsmodell f√ºr einen Angriff und warum ist dieses bedeutungsvoll?**
> 
> Die beiden russischen Voronezh-DMs in der Anlage bei Armawir sind ein integraler Bestandteil des strategischen Fr√ºhwarnerkennungssystems Russlands, und ihr Ausfall k√∂nnte die F√§higkeit des Landes, ankommende nukleare Bedrohungen zu erkennen, beeintr√§chtigen. Im Moment befinden sich die russischen Streitkr√§fte in der Ukraine in der Initiative. Dies wird zudem hinterlegt bzw. abgesichert mit fortlaufenden russischen Drohungen betreffend eines Einsatzes von Mitteln des eigenen Nuklearpotentials.
> 
> Im Herbst 2022, kurz vor dem √ºberraschenden Abzug der vor dem Einschluss stehenden russischen Truppen aus dem Br√ºckenkopf bei Cherson, berichteten die US-Geheimdienste von m√∂glichen Vorbereitungen eines russischen taktischen Nukleareinsatzes. Nicht zuletzt derartige Ereignisse erkl√§ren das √ºberlegte, aber nicht √ºberschie√üende Vorgehen der USA (Strategie ‚ÄûBoiling the Frog‚Äú) gegen√ºber Russland. Es ist daher durchaus schl√ºssig, dass die USA mit dem durch die Ukraine ausgef√ºhrten Angriff auf die Voronezh-DMs in Armawir Russland zeigen m√∂chte, dass man die unertr√§gliche Situation der russischen Drohungen mit Atomwaffen nicht l√§nger akzeptieren m√∂chte.
> 
> Ist dies tats√§chlich der Fall, lassen sich zwei weitere Feststellungen treffen: Erstens ist die Lage in der Ukraine √ºberaus ernst und zweitens ist der Krieg um die Ukraine neuerlich eskaliert. Es bleibt nun abzuwarten, wie oder ob Russland auf diesen Angriff auf seine nukleare Abschreckungskapazit√§t reagiert. Das russische Fr√ºhwarnerkennungssystem ist Teil der nuklearen Abschreckungsstrategie des Landes. Der Angriff auf Armavir k√∂nnte die Bedingungen erf√ºllen, die Russland im Jahr 2020 √∂ffentlich f√ºr gegnerische Angriffe festgelegt hat, die einen nuklearen Vergeltungsschlag ausl√∂sen k√∂nnten. Hinzu kommt der Umstand, dass eine m√∂gliche Zusammenarbeit Russlands mit seinen engen Verb√ºndeten im Raum eingeschr√§nkt wurde, zum Vorteil von engen Partnern der USA.

1d2mhnl,UA PoV - Austrian Colonel Reisner comments on consequences of Ukrainian attacks on Russian nuclear deterrent - Austrian Army portal,l61deix,"**A suspected Ukrainian drone attack on a radar system of the Russian nuclear early warning system, which is designed to detect incoming intercontinental nuclear missiles, has allegedly caused serious damage. According to military expert Colonel Markus Reisner, this has the potential to trigger a new, dangerous escalation. Colonel Reisner answers the three key questions:**

**1. Why is the alleged Ukrainian drone attack on the Russian Armavir radar station in the southwest of the Krasnodar region particularly remarkable?**

The images that emerged the day before yesterday show that at least one of the two Russian Voronezh-DM early warning radar systems stationed in Armavir was seriously damaged in a targeted attack. Russia currently has up to ten such early warning radar systems. They are spread across Russia, at sites in Murmansk, near St. Petersburg, in Kaliningrad, in Barnaul, in Omsk, near Irkutsk, near Vorkuta, in Krasnogorsk and in the aforementioned Armavir. The latter system, consisting of two radars, was built to compensate for similar Soviet systems originally installed in western Ukraine and Crimea.

These Voronezh-DM radars are ""Over-the-Horizon"" (OTH) - ""Ultra High Frequency"" (UHF) radars, which are part of the Russian early warning radar system for detecting ballistic missiles. The radars have a range of 6,000 kilometers horizontally and 8,000 kilometers vertically. Their aim is to be able to detect incoming American nuclear missiles at an early stage in order to be able to quickly initiate their own measures, including, in extreme cases, a Russian nuclear counterattack. It is also conceivable that early warning data could be passed on to allies such as Iran, North Korea or China.

**2. What benefit would Ukraine have from such an attack on Russian early warning radar systems?**

Ukraine now only has missile weapons with a limited range. Its own systems such as Tochka-U have been used up, and the most notable system supplied by the West is the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) from the USA. This has a range of 300 kilometers at a flight path altitude of up to 60 kilometers. One could speculate that the Ukrainian armed forces may have targeted Armavir because they feared that the site could help provide advance warning for their attacks with ballistic ATACMS supplied by the USA. However, Armavir is located almost 700 kilometers from possible ATACMS launch sites near Kherson. This means that due to the Voronezh-DM radar horizon, it is difficult to detect ATACMS missiles flying at low altitudes at this range. The targeted incoming missile should be at an altitude of at least over a thousand kilometers for accurate measurement. Intercontinental missiles usually fly at altitudes of up to 2,000 kilometers - within the optimal detection range of the Voronezh-DM radar. Other radar systems are planned for tactical short-range missiles, such as ATACMS.¬†

**3. Is there another explanatory model for an attack and why is it significant?**

The two Russian Voronezh DMs at the Armavir facility are an integral part of Russia's strategic early warning system, and their failure could affect the country's ability to detect incoming nuclear threats. At the moment, the Russian armed forces in Ukraine have the initiative. This is also backed up by ongoing Russian threats to use its own nuclear potential.

In the fall of 2022, shortly before the surprise withdrawal of Russian troops from the bridgehead near Kherson, which was about to be surrounded, US intelligence reported on possible preparations for a Russian tactical nuclear strike. Such events explain, not least, the US's considered but not excessive approach (""Boiling the Frog"" strategy) towards Russia. It is therefore quite logical that the US, with the attack on the Voronezh DMs in Armavir carried out by Ukraine, wants to show Russia that it no longer wants to accept the intolerable situation of Russian threats with nuclear weapons.

If this is indeed the case, two further conclusions can be drawn: first, the situation in Ukraine is extremely serious and second, the war over Ukraine has escalated again. It now remains to be seen how or if Russia will respond to this attack on its nuclear deterrence capability. The Russian early warning detection system is part of the country's nuclear deterrence strategy. The attack on Armavir could fulfill the conditions that Russia publicly set out in 2020 for adversary attacks that could trigger a nuclear retaliation. In addition, possible cooperation between Russia and its close allies in the space has been limited, to the benefit of close US partners."
1d2mhnl,UA PoV - Austrian Colonel Reisner comments on consequences of Ukrainian attacks on Russian nuclear deterrent - Austrian Army portal,l61i64s,It's explicitly listed in the Russian MOD articles and in a congressional report on said articles/subject that Russia Considers' attacks on nuclear infrastructure and defense stations concerning such as a direct threat to the existence of the state thus opening things up to the possible use of thermonuclear weapons.
1d2mhnl,UA PoV - Austrian Colonel Reisner comments on consequences of Ukrainian attacks on Russian nuclear deterrent - Austrian Army portal,l61f1fs,"The important part is he thinks it is plausible the US is behind this attack, which means Russia probably came to the same conclusion. Which also means that it is very likely Russia will retaliate (tit for tat) against the US."
1d2mhnl,UA PoV - Austrian Colonel Reisner comments on consequences of Ukrainian attacks on Russian nuclear deterrent - Austrian Army portal,l61gbqp,"With a little bit of bad luck, we are indeed sleepwalking into a nuclear escalation in the short and medium term future. All because Western ""elites"" (such as they are) are seemingly not capable of thinking further than the next quarter, and are driven by a collective mania to look good on social media. This is a slight exaggeration, of course: but unfortunately only a slight one.

In reality, it would not hurt NATO and Western interests all that much if they were to lose the war in Ukraine in a controlled fashion. As in, Russia gains some territories east of the Dnieper, and Ukraine is neutralised. So what, in the larger scheme of things.

In the panic driven and short sighted narrative of day to day social media it would of course look horrible, if this were to happen. And indeed, this would not be a happy day for NATO and the West. Ukraine deserves better.

But it would still be way better than a nuclear escalation no one can win. 

Putin is 70 years old, has no clear successor: and while Russia can apparently sustain a war economy way better than Western analysts had surmised at first, it will inevitably run out of steam sometime. If they win all of Ukraine east of the Dnieper, it will still be a victory that was won at crippling cost. While NATO can regroup, rearm, and make long term plans.

If they get into a nuclear fight, on the other hand, it will end extremely badly for everyone involved.

However, the more I see of people like Stoltenberg (who is an old man, and total failure at his job), or Victoria Nuland (the less said the better), the less I am sure that these people don't just want to see the world burn. They fucked up, they are old, and cannot possibly admit they made mistakes in how they handled the Russian threat. That is a terrible recipe for de-escalation, if people with nothing to lose, and who are surrounded by sycophantic aides, are with their backs to the wall.

Nuland already left, but the rest are not much better: and are seem to be convinced that they are looking down the abyss. When in reality, they could afford to lose this war, and retain the ability to fight (and win) another day."
